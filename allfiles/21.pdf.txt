Multiobjective Investment Policy for a Nonlinear
Stochastic Financial System: A Fuzzy Approach

Chien-Feng Wu, Bor-Sen Chen, Life Fellow, IEEE, and Weihai Zhang, Senior Member, IEEE

AbstractThe nancial market always suffers from continuous
and discontinuous (jump) changes and can be regarded as a
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system. Most investors expect
their investment policies to be not only higher benets but also
lower risk as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). In this
study, a multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment is proposed for
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial systems to achieve
the desired target with minimum investment cost and risk in
Pareto optimal sense, simultaneously. The TakagiSugeno (TS)
fuzzy model is used to approximate the nonlinear stochastic jump
diffusion nancial system to simplify the multiobjective H2 /H
investment policy design procedure. By the help of the TS fuzzy
model, the multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment policy prob-
lem of nonlinear stochastic nancial system can be transformed
to
linear-matrix-inequality-constrained (LMI-constrained)
MOP to avoid solving the annoying HamiltonJacobi inequalities.
Because the LMI-constrained MOP is not easy to directly calculate
its Pareto optimal solutions, an indirect method is proposed to
solve this MOP for the multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment
policy design of nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial
systems. An LMI-constrained multiobjective evolution algorithm
(LMI-constrained MOEA) is also developed to efciently solve
the Pareto optimal solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP for
the multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment policy design of
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial systems. When the
Pareto optimal regulation solutions are solved by the proposed
LMI-constrained MOEA,
investors can select one investment
policy to achieve their desired target with minimum investment
cost and risk according to his/her own preference.

I. INTRODUCTION

of the interaction between nonlinear factors, all kinds of
economic problems become more and more complicated today.
Different types of mathematical model for the nancial systems
have been widely studied. In recent years, researchers focus
on the system dynamical model to describe the real economic

and nancial systems [1][5]. However, in practical cases, the
nancial dynamic system is a nonlinear stochastic system and
may suffer from continuous and discontinuous parametric uc-
tuations due to national and international situation change, oil
price change, the surplus between investment and savings, the
variable of interest rate, false economy policy, etc. Thus, us-
ing a nonlinear stochastic dynamical model to describe a real
nancial system would be more appealing [6][9]. The stochas-
tic parametric uctuations can be decomposed as continuous
state-dependent uctuations and discontinuous (jump) state-
dependent uctuations. Both of them will inuence the sta-
bility of the stochastic nancial dynamical system. Moreover,
the external investment disturbance due to the unpredictable
investment-environmental changes or a worldwide event, such
as war, natural disaster, fatal epidemic disease, etc., can also
affect the uctuations of nancial system. Thus, in this study, a
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system with internal random
uctuation and external disturbance is employed to describe a
nonlinear stochastic nancial system.

Managers and investors always expect their investment poli-
cies to be with not only higher return on investment (ROI) but
also lower risk. Because the ROI and lower investment risks
normally conict with each other, investment policy can be re-
garded as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). Thus,
the multiobjective investment policies appear naturally and are
also widely applied in nancial systems [10]. For a nancial
system, the multiobjective H2/H investment policy design for
the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system can be
seen as how to search a management policy to maximize ROI
(H2 management policy) and minimize investment risk (H
management policy), simultaneously.

Robust regulation control is to design a state feedback con-
troller to ensure that the trajectories of the controlled system
gradually converge to some desired trajectories (target) despite
intrinsic noise and extrinsic disturbance [11], [19], [24], [25],
[33]. It is particularly appropriate to be employed in nancial
system. The most two important topics of robust optimal regula-
tion control are how to minimize the regulation error to achieve
the desired target despite intrinsic uctuation and how to in-
crease the system robustness to reject the effect due to envi-
ronmental disturbance. The optimal H2 management policy is
proposed to minimize the regulation error to achieve the desired
reference target despite intrinsic uctuation [13][15]. The ro-
bust H management policy is introduced to reduce the ef-
fects of external disturbances on the regulation performance.
For a nancial system, the H2 optimal regulation control can
be regarded as how to design an investment policy to ensure

that the nancial system can gradually converge to the ex-
pectant trajectories of managers or investors and minimize the
investment cost, i.e., a higher ROI policy. On the other hand,
the robust H regulation control for a nancial system can be
seen as how to design a manageable policy to minimize the
investment risk due to intrinsic continuous and discontinuous
random uctuations and external disturbance. However, both of
optimal H2 and robust H management policy need to solve a
difcult Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI) (a second-order non-
linear partial differential equation) to achieve a desired steady
state (target) of nonlinear stochastic nancial system. To over-
come this difcult problem, i.e., solving HJI, the TakagiSugeno
(TS) fuzzy model is employed to simplify the multiobjective
H2/H investment policy problem of nonlinear stochastic -
nancial systems in this study.

Recently, the TS fuzzy model has been widely used to ef-
ciently approximate nonlinear systems [17][20], and a TS
fuzzy controller has also been successfully applied to the stabi-
lization control design for nonlinear system. To avoid solving
the annoying HJIs, the TS fuzzy model is employed to approx-
imate the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system
by interpolating several local linear stochastic jump diffusion
nancial systems at different operation points. When a nonlin-
ear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system was represented
by an interpolation of a set of linear stochastic jump diffusion
nancial systems, a TS fuzzy model-based regulation method
can also be developed to achieve the multiobjective H2/H
investment policy. Thus, the HJIs can be replaced by a set of
linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). These LMIs can be efciently
solved by a convex optimization method to complete the mul-
tiobjective H2/H fuzzy investment policy design. Therefore,
the multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem of the
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system becomes
to how to solve an LMI-constrained MOP.

Although a number of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms
(MOEAs) have been discussed for their ability to efciently
search the Pareto optimal solutions of MOP in a single run [27]
[30], [32], [41], most of them focus on the multiobjective prob-
lem with algebraic functional systems or algebraic constraints.
Few of these studies discuss the system dynamical constrained
MOP for the nonlinear stochastic nancial system, in which
robust stability must be guaranteed beforehand. More effort is
still needed to apply the MOEA to solve the MOP for mul-
tiobjective H2/H investment policy of nonlinear stochastic
nancial systems. Based on the TS fuzzy model, the multi-
objective H2/H investment policy problem of the nonlinear
stochastic jump diffusion nancial system can be transformed
to an LMI-constrained MOP. In general, there exists no unique
solution for LMI-constrained MOP. The multiple solutions of
MOP are called Pareto optimal solutions. To efciently solve
the multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem of the
nonlinear nancial system, an indirect method is introduced to
help us approach the Pareto optimal solutions at the Pareto front
of the LMI-constrained MOP by gradually decreasing the upper
bound of H2 and H performance indices, i.e., nondominating
searching scheme is employed to nd Pareto front for Pareto
optimal solutions of management policy without violating the
stability of nonlinear stochastic system, simultaneously.

The proposed LMI-constrained MOEA combines the LMI
technique with MOEA together to solve the LMI-constrained
MOP for multiobjective H2/H investment policy of non-
linear stochastic jump diffusion nancial systems. The LMI-
constrained MOEA search algorithm via a number of genetic
operation, e.g., selection, mutation, and crossover, is proposed
with the help of LMI toolbox in MATLAB to efciently search
for Pareto front of Pareto optimal solutions and its corresponding
fuzzy regulation gains {Ki} from the LMI constraints to meet
the robust stability and multiobjective H2/H policy optimiza-
tion of nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial systems,
simultaneously. As long as the Pareto front can be obtained, the
multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem for a non-
linear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system can also be
solved, and the manager(or investor) can select a mutual benet
policy according to his/her own preference.

II. PRELIMINARIES

In [1] and [5], a nancial dynamical model is given to illustrate
the interaction between interesting rate, x, investment demand,
y, and the price index, z of a nancial system as follows:






x(t) = z(t) + (y(t)  a) x(t)
y(t) = 1  by(t)  (x(t))2
z(t) = x(t)  cz(t)

(1)

where the parameters a  0 is the saving amount, b  0 is the
per-investment cost, and c  0 is the elasticity of demands of
commercials. In the nonlinear nancial model (1), the interest
rate x(t) can be inuenced by the surplus between investment
and saving as well as adjustments of the prices. The investment
demand y(t) is proportional to the rate of investment and
inversely proportional to the cost of investment and the interest
rate. The price index z(t) depends on the difference between
supply and demand in the market, and it is also inuenced by
the ination rate.

However, in practice, most nancial systems are stochas-
tic systems, and the dynamical model in (1) may suffer from
parametric uctuations due to the surplus between investment
and savings, oil price, or government policy changes. To mimic
the real nancial system, the dynamical model in (1) should
be modied by continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random

Thus, the stochastic nonlinear autonomous controlled system
for the nancial system in (2) can be written as follows (see
system diagram in Fig. 1):

the nonlinear nancial system. The nonlinear stochastic system in (3) is to be
controlled to achieve the desired steady state xd by the multiobjective H2 /H
regulator. In order to achieve the desired steady state xd , the original nonlinear
stochastic nancial system in (3) is shifted to xd so that the regulation problem
to xd becomes a stabilization problem of the nonlinear stochastic system in (5).
When the shifted stochastic nancial system in (5) is completely approximated
by the TS fuzzy model, the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem
in (18) can be regarded as an LMI-constrained MOP in (20) by employing the
proposed indirect method in Lemma 2. Since the LMI-constrained MOP in (20)
is difcult to solve by directly calculating, we proposed the LMI-constrained
MOEA to efciently solve the LMI-constrained MOP in (20). Thus, the multiob-
jective H2 /H investment policy problem for a nonlinear stochastic nancial
system can be efciently solved by commercial software MATLAB.

uctuations and environmental disturbance. In the following, the
Wiener process (i.e., Brownian motion) and the marked Poisson
process are introduced to model the continuous and discontin-
uous random uctuations in real nancial system (see Fig. 1).
More precisely speaking, a nancial market, which refers to the
buy and sell behavior, can be described as a stochastic dynamical
nancial system. Thus, the stochastic dynamical system can be
employed to describe the price changes of the objects of trans-
action (like stocks, bonds, futures, and oil ) or economic index
changes (investment rate, price index, and investment demand)
[36], [38]. One of the most famous stochastic nancial systems
is the stochastic stock price system [36].
Let (,F,Ft ,P) be a ltration probability space with
F ={Ft : t  0}.F is generated by the following two mutually
independent stochastic processes: 1) One-dimensional standard
Wiener process W (t); and 2) the marked Poisson processes
N (t; k ), for k = 1, 2, .., m, and the ltration Ft is also gen-
erated by -algebra of W (s) and -algebra of marked Poisson
processes N (s; k ), where k = 1, 2, .., m, for s < t.

The nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system with
continuous and discontinuous random uctuations in (1) can be
described as follows:

is regarded as an unknown nite energy stochastic external dis-
turbance and denotes the external disturbance caused by the in-
ternational situation like war or natural disaster. Since 1-D stan-
dard Wiener process W(t) is a continuous but nondifferentiable
stochastic process, the term o(x(t))dW (t) can be regarded as
a continuous state-dependent internal random uctuation, i.e.,
the nancial system random uctuation dependent on the cur-
rent magnitude of investment rate, price index, and investment
demand; the term  = {1, 2, ..., m}  R1 is the mark space
of Poisson random processes and denotes the set of all minding
nancial emergencial incidents, which will cause discontinuous
changes of the system in (3); the mark k denotes a nancial
emergencial incident in the discussed nancial system such as
nancial tsunami, company merger, hot money inow or the
collapse of bank; and the term o (x (t), k ) denotes a suddenly
violent change (the magnitude jump) at investment rate, price in-
dex, and investment demand of the stochastic nancial system in
(3) when the nancial emergencial incident happens. Thus, the
k=1 o (x(t), k ) dN (t; k ) denotes all the
summation term
possible nonlinear stochastic discontinuous changes of the sys-
tem in (3) at the time instant t, whose jump amplitudes depend
on the corresponding jump coefcient functional o (x(t), k ).
It is necessary to note that in this paper, we assume all the emer-
gencial incidents are mutually exclusive event (i.e., when the
jump occurs at time instant t, there is only one mark k to be
assigned). In this study, we use 3-D nonlinear nancial system
(1) to illustrate the nancial multiobjective design. However, the
nancial stochastic system in (2) or (3) can be extended to any

we have fo : Rn  Rn , o : Rn  Rn , o : Rn    Rn
and Bo  Rnp when u(t)  L2F(R+; Rp).
Some important properties of Poisson jump process are given
as follows [7]:
1) E {dN (t; k )} = k dt where the nite scalar number
2) E {[dN (t; k )] dt} = 0, for all k.
3) E {[dN (t; k )] dW} = 0, for all k.
4) E {[dN (t; k1 )] [dN (t; k2 )]} = 0, for all k1 (cid:8)= k2.
5) E {[dN (t; k1 )] [dN (t; k2 )]} = k1 dt, for all k1 = k2.
In fact, managers or investors always expect that the dynamic
behaviors of the invested nancial system are satised with their
expectation. Thus, the multiobjective optimal control theories
are particularly suited for the multiobjective investment policy
problem of nancial systems.

From the system diagram in Fig. 1,

the regulation
is to de-
purpose of stochastic nancial system in (3)
sign regulation effort u(t) so that 1)
the intrinsic ran-
dom continuous and discontinuous uctuations o (x(t)) dW
k=1 o (x(t), k )dN (t; k ) could be tolerated by the
and
stochastic nancial system; 2) the effect of external disturbance
v (t) on the regulation performance of nancial system should
be as small as possible, i.e., with a less risk; and 3) the desired
target xd could be nally achieved with a low cost.

In order to regulate x(t) to the desired steady state (target)
xd, for the convenience of control design, the origin of nonlin-
ear stochastic nancial system in (3) should be shifted to xd
at rst. In such a situation, if the shifted nonlinear stochastic
nancial system is robustly stabilized at the origin, then the ro-
bust regulation of x (t) to the desired state(target) xd will be
equivalently achieved. This will simplify the regulation control
design procedure of the stochastic nonlinear nancial system.
Let us denote

x(t) = x(t)  xd .

(4)

Then, we get the following shifted nonlinear stochastic nan-

cial system in (3) as follows:
dx(t) = (f (x(t)) + Bu(t) + v(t)) dt +  (x(t)) dW

the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system in (5) without
consideration of v(t) is dened as follows:
J2 (u(t)) = (cid:4)x(t)(cid:4)2L2F (R+ ;R3 ,Q 1 ) + (cid:4)u(t)(cid:4)2L2F (R+ ;R3 ,R 1 )
where Q1 > 0 and R1 > 0 are weighting matrices to tradeoff
between regulation error x (t) and investment effort u(t).

(6)

To avoid the investment risk from the external disturbance,
the H control performance index J(u (t)) of the nonlinear
stochastic nancial system in (5) is dened as follows:

J(u(t)) =

sup

v(t)  L2F(R+ , R3),

v (cid:8)= 0, x0 = 0

(cid:4)x(t)(cid:4)2L2F (R+ ;R3 ,Q 2 ) + (cid:4)u(t)(cid:4)2L2F (R+ ;R3 ,R 2 )

(cid:4)v(t)(cid:4)2L2F (R+ ;R3 )

if x(0) = x0 = 0

(7)

where Q2 > 0, R2 > 0, i.e., the worst-case effect from the ex-
ogenous disturbance v(t)  L2F(R+; R3) to the regulation er-
rors x(t) and regulation effort u (t) from the average energy
point of view. The H performance index J(u(t)) in (7) can
be considered as the worst-case investment risk from external
disturbance. Since the external disturbance is unpredictable, the
worst-case effect of external disturbance is considered in the
investment risk.

In this study, from the system diagram of nonlinear stochas-
tic nancial system in Fig. 1, we want to design a multiobjec-
tive H2/H robust investment policy for system state x (t) to
achieve a desired state xd from the perspective of minimum H2
regulation error with minimum investment effort u (t) in (6) and
minimum H investment risk in (7) under intrinsic uctuations
and external disturbance. A more detailed design procedure of
the multiobjective H2/H robust investment policy u (t) to si-
multaneously minimize J2 (u (t)) in (6) and J (u (t)) in (7)
will be discussed in the following.
Remark 1: If the initial condition x (0) = x0 (cid:8)= 0 , then the

H performance index J(u(t)) should be rewritten as

J(u(t)) =

where f (x(t)) = fo (x(t) + xd) ,  (x(t)) = o (x(t) + xd),
and  (x(t), k ) = o (x(t) + xd , k ).

Thus, the origin x(t) = 0 of the nonlinear stochastic nan-
cial system in (5) is at the desired steady state (target) xd of
the original nonlinear stochastic nancial system in (3), i.e., the
investment policy problem of regulating nonlinear stochastic -
nancial system in (3) to the desired xd is transformed to the
stabilization problem of the shifted nonlinear stochastic nan-
cial system in (5).

In order to achieve the desired state xd with less regulation
effort u(t) in spite of continuous and discontinuous random
uctuation, the H2 control performance J2 (u(t)) index for

III. MULTIOBJECTIVE H2/H INVESTMENT POLICY DESIGN
FOR NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC FINANCIAL JUMP SYSTEM VIA

FUZZY INTERPOLATION METHOD

In general, construction of the multiobjective H2/H reg-
ulation control for nonlinear stochastic system needs to solve
an HJI-constrained MOP, which is difcult to be solved analyt-
ically or numerically. To overcome this difcult problem, the
TS fuzzy interpolation method is employed here to approxi-
mate the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system
in (5). The TS fuzzy dynamical model is proposed to approx-
imate the nonlinear stochastic system in (5) by interpolating
several local linearized stochastic jump diffusion nancial sys-
tems around some operation points [17][20], [34], [39], [40].
This TS fuzzied model is described by a group of IFTHEN
rules and is used to simplify the multiobjective H2/H invest-
ment policy design problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump
diffusion nancial system. The ith rule of this TS fuzzy model
for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system in
(5) is described by

System Rule :

and Gij (zj ) is the membership grade of zj in Gij . From the

denitions given above, we have

l(cid:12)

i=1

hi(z) = 1.

(13)

The physical meaning of fuzzy model in (11) is that the

following l locally linearized nancial systems

dx(t) = [Ai x(t) + Bu(t) + v(t)] dt + Ci x(t)dW (t)
for 1  i  l

Ei(k )x (t) dN (t; k ) ,

k=1

(14)

at different operation points (different fuzzy set Gij ) are in-
terpolated smoothly via the fuzzy certainty function hi(z) to
approximate the original nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion
nancial system in (5).

Similarly,

the multiobjective H2/H investment policy
u (t) = K(x (t)) for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion
nancial system could be approximated by the following fuzzy
investment policy:

Investment Policy i :
for i = 1, 2, . . . l
if z1 is Gi1 and  and zg is Gig , then u (t) = Ki x(t).
(15)
The overall multiobjective H2/H investment policy u (t)
for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system can
be represented by

u (t) =

l(cid:12)

i=1

hi(z)Ki x (t)

(16)

where hi(z) is designed as (11); Ki is the regulation gain for
the ith fuzzy linearized system for i = 1, 2, . . . l.

The fuzzy parameters Ai, Ci, and Ei(k ) of l local linear -
nancial systems in (11) can be easily identied by system identi-
cation toolbox in MATLAB. If adequate number of fuzzy rules
is used in the TS fuzzy system in (11), then the fuzzy approx-
imation error could be considered as one kind of parametric
uctuations, and the proposed robust H2/H multiobjective
investment policy can efciently override these parametric uc-
tuations due to fuzzy approximation. Therefore, the multiobjec-
tive H2/H investment policy problem can be regarded as how
to design fuzzy investment policy u(t) in (16) so that the TS
stochastic nancial system in (11) could achieve the multiob-
jective H2/H investment policy in (6) and (7).

A higher benet investment behavior always couples with
higher risk and higher capital cost. The optimal H2 regulation

WU et al.: MULTIOBJECTIVE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR A NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC FINANCIAL SYSTEM: A FUZZY APPROACH

465

in (6) expects the energy of regulation error x (t) and admissible
investment policy u (t) as lower as possible, i.e., use a minimum
capital to earn a desired benet. However, for the robust H reg-
ulation design, a better (less) H performance index is always
coupled with a higher capital cost to reject intrinsic continuous
and discontinuous uctuation as well as external disturbance to
achieve the desired target xd with a less risk. It is clear that the
optimal H2 regulation design and robust H regulation design
are mutually conicted. Thus, designing a controller (invest-
ment policy) to optimize the H2 performance index J2 (u(t))
and the H performance index J(u (t)) is indeed a MOP of
nancial regulation systems. The denition of the multiobjec-
tive H2/H investment policy for the nonlinear stochastic jump
diffusion nancial system is given as

Denition 1: The multiobjective H2/H investment policy
of a given nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump diffusion nancial
system (11) is to design an admissible investment policy u(t)
in (16), which could make the H2 and H performance indices
minimum in the Pareto optimal sense, simultaneously, i.e.

(J2(u(t)), J(u(t)))

min
u(t)U
s.t. (11)

(17)

where U is the set of all the admissible investment policy for
the given nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system;
the objective functional J2(u (t)) and J(u (t)) are dened in
(6) and (7), respectively; the vector of the objective functionals
(J2(u (t)), J(u (t))) is called objective vector of u (t).

Lemma 2 (see [35]): Suppose  and  are the upper bounds
of the H2 and H performance indices, respectively, i.e.,
J2(u (t))  , and J(u (t))  . The MOP in (17) is equiv-
alent to the MOP given in the following:

(, )

min
u(t)U
s.t. J2(u (t))   and J(u (t))  .

(18)



, 

Proof: The proof of this lemma is straightforward. One only
needs to prove that both inequalities contained in the multiobjec-
tive problem in (18) become equal for Pareto optimal solutions.
We will show this by contradiction. Given a 3-tuple Pareto op-
) of MOP in (18), we assume that
timal solution (u(t), 
either one of the inequality in (18) remains a strict inequality
at the Pareto optimal solution. Without loss of generality, sup-
pose that J2(u(t)) < 
. As the result, there exists 1 such that
and J2(u(t)) = 1. Now, for the same u(t), the so-
1 < 
),
lution (, 
leading to a contradiction. This implies that both inequality con-
straints in MOP (18) indeed become equality for Pareto optimal
solutions. The optimization problem in (18) is, hence, equivalent
to the MOP described in (17).

) dominates the Pareto optimal solution (

In this study, Lemma 2 provides an indirect method to solve
the multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem of non-
linear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system.

appropriate dimension, we have

Then, the following theorems will provide the sufcient con-
dition for the fuzzy investment policy u(t) in (16) to solve the
multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem for nonlin-
ear stochastic jump nancial system in (5). In the following,
according to two kinds of Poisson noise in stochastic nancial
systems, i.e., marked Poisson process N (t; k ) and marked
compensation Poisson processes N (t; k ), the multiobjective
H2/H investment policy problem will be solved separately in
the following.

Remark 2: In this study, we use the 3-D nonlinear stochas-
tic nancial system to illustrate the proposed multiobjective
H2/H investment theories. However, the proposed theories
can be extended to the n-dimensional nonlinear stochastic nan-
cial system, i.e., the system state x(t) of the nonlinear stochas-
tic nancial system in (5) can be of arbitrary n-dimension. At
this situation (n-dimentional nonlinear stochastic nancial sys-
tem), the nonlinear functions are dened as f :Rn  Rn ,  :
Rn  Rn , and  : Rn    Rn , which are nonlinear Borel
measurable continuous functions. Moreover, these constant ma-
trices Ai, Ci, and Ei (k ) for the TS fuzzy model in (11)
and (43) should be Rnn matrices and B  Rnp where u
(t)  Rnp. Once the n-dimensional nonlinear stochastic -
nancial system can be approximated by the TS fuzzy model,
the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA can efciently solve the
multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem, too.

IV. MULTIOBJECTIVE H2/H INVESTMENT POLICY OF THE
NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC FINANCIAL SYSTEM DESIGN VIA

LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA ALGORITHM

The MOEA is a stochastic search method by simulating the
natural selection in natural evolution. It is also particularly
suitable for solving the multiobjective investment optimiza-
tion problem of nonlinear stochastic nancial systems due to
its population-based nature, permitting a set of Pareto optimal
solutions to be obtained in a single run. For a multiobjective
H2/H investment policy problem of nonlinear stochastic jump
diffusion nancial system, the MOP in Theorems 1 and 3 with
LMI constraints to guarantee the robust stability of nonlinear
stochastic nancial system of (5) or (11) under continuous and
discontinuous parametric uctuations and external disturbance.
It is not easy to solve the MOP in Theorem 1 or Theorem 3,
directly. In this section, an LMI-constrained MOEA searching
algorithm is developed to help us solve the MOP in Theorem 1
or Theorem 3, iteratively. Before further discussion, some im-
portant denitions of Pareto optimality of an LMI-constrained
MOP for nonlinear stochastic nancial system are given
as follows:

The LMI-constrained MOP for the nonlinear stochastic nan-
cial system is concerned with evolution algorithm (EA). For the
proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the EA operates on a num-
ber of encoding feasible objective vectors called population so
that for a feasible objective vector (k , k ), it should be encoded
into a chromosome Ck . A feasible chromosome Ck is dened
as a coded feasible objective vector. The chromosome of EA for
the LMI-constrained MOEA employs the real-valued represen-
tation to avoid long binary string and large searching space in
EA for the multiobjective H2/H investment policy of the non-
linear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system. In general, EA
takes population to be the algorithm input and return the chro-
mosomes with tness performance to be the next population.
The LMI-constraints in (20)(22) to guarantee robust stability
of nancial system and the two upper bounds  and  are just
like the environments in natural evolution. Only the adaptive
chromosomes survive. For guaranteeing that all of these chro-
mosomes can be decoded as the feasible objective vectors for
the MOP in (19), each chromosome Ck should be examined by
in LMIs
the existence of a feasible solution
in (20)(22) with the LMI toolbox in MATLAB after mating
operation. If some chromosomes are not feasible, these chromo-
somes need to be canceled from the candidate chromosomes. It
is worth to mention that LMI constraints in (20)(22) impose
more restrictions on the searching of the feasible chromosomes
than the conventional MOEA approach. Besides, using the LMI
toolbox in MATLAB could help efciently examine whether
these chromosomes satisfy the LMIs in (20)(22), which ac-
celerates the selection speed of the initial populations via the
initialization scheme.

tation ratio Nm , and generate 2Np number feasible
chromosomes by examining whether their correspond-
ing objective vectors are feasible objective vectors for
the LMIs in (20)(22).

Step 5: Set the iteration index Ni = Ni + 1 and select Np
chromosomes from the 2Np feasible chromosomes in

V. SIMULATION RESULTS

To illustrate the design procedure and to conrm the perfor-
mance of the proposed optimal investment policy for nonlinear
stochastic jump diffusion nancial system, we introduce a non-
linear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system to mimic an
emerging market in (2). In general, an emerging market al-
ways suffer from continuous and discontinuous intrinsic ran-
dom uctuations due to national and international situation
change, oil price change, the surplus between investment and
saving, the variable of interest rate, etc. The external invest-
ment disturbance is caused by the unpredictable investment
changes or worldwide events such as war, nature disaster, fatal
epidemic, etc.

The external investment disturbance is assumed to be

Fig. 3 is used to describe the dynamical behaviors of the
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system in (2) with
much uctuations in real situation. It is seen that the three states
x(t), y(t), and z(t) of the nonlinear stochastic nancial sys-
tem uctuate with random jumps. Therefore, the multiobjective
H2/H investment policy of the MOP in (17) is employed
by the government to design an investment policy to regulate
the stochastic nancial system to achieve the following desired
steady state:

xd = (0.1, 4.5,  0.2)

(53)

i.e., the government of emerging market expects its nancial
system to be regulated to achieve a desired nancial steady state
with interest rate 0.1, investment demand 4.5, and price index
0.2 to coordinate ination rate, supply and demand in the
emerging market to stimulate the recovery of emerging market
under continuous and discontinuous random uctuation.

In this example, we assume the vector of premise vari-
ables z = [x1(t), x2(t)]T = [z1(t), z2(t)]T in (11) and (16)
is available in the regulation design. Since there are eight fuzzy
sets associated with premise variable z1(t) and eight fuzzy sets
associated with premise variable z2(t), totally there are 64 fuzzy
IFTHEN rules, in the TS fuzzy nancial system. The operation

point of the TS fuzzy model and their linearized local lin-
ear stochastic models are shown in the Appendix. Suppose the
weighting matrices in the multiobjective H2/H investment
policy in (17) is used to regulate the stochastic nancial system
with the following weighting matrices:

Q1 = I33, R1 = I33, Q2 = I33, R2 = 0.5I33.

Based on the proposed design procedure of the multiobjec-
tive H2/H optimal investment policy, the MOEA algorithm
is employed to solve the MOP in (19). In the MOEA algo-
rithm, the searching region  is set as  = [0 70]  [0.4
1.2],
the maximum number of individuals Np = 80, iteration num-
ber Ni = 100, crossover rate Nc = 0.8, and mutation ratio
Nm = 0.2.
Once the iteration number N = 100 is achieved, the Pareto
front PF for the Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP for the
investment policy of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion
nancial system of the emerging market in (5) or (11) can be
obtained as shown in Fig. 4.

In order to illustrate how to select the preferable solution of
the investment policy, we choose three Pareto optimal solutions
from the Pareto front for comparison, whose Pareto objective
vectors are given in Table I. Moreover, in Figs. 57, the simu-
lation results of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nan-
cial system for the emerging market are given to illustrate the
performance of the multiobjective H2/H optimal fuzzy in-
vestment policy of the three chosen Pareto optimal solutions
for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial system in
(5) or (11). The corresponding P matrices in (20) of the three
chosen Pareto solutions are also given in Table II. In Figs. 5
7, the Pareto optimal solution 1 has the best J performance

index of the three chosen Pareto optimal solutions so that the
trajectory of Pareto optimal solution 1 has the minimum pertur-
bation but has the maximum J2 performance index. However,
for the Pareto optimal solution 3, it has the minimum J2 perfor-
mance index, but its trajectory has the maximum perturbation of
the three because it has the maximum J performance index. It
is easy to observe that Pareto solution 2 is the preferable regu-
lation solution of the three chosen Pareto solutions because the

Pareto solution 2 is a compromise solution for J2 and J in the
multiobjective investment policy problem of nonlinear stochas-
tic jump diffusion nancial system. However, these three Pareto
optimal solutions have satisfactory regulation results to achieve
their desired steady states of the nancial system in spite of
intrinsic continuous and discontinuous random uctuation and
external disturbance, respectively.

VI. CONCLUSION

This study has investigated the multiobjective H2 /H invest-
ment policy for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial
systems via the TS fuzzy model interpolation method. Unlike
the most multiobjective problems only focusing on algebraic
systems by the indirect method in Lemma 2, the proposed mul-
tiobjective H2/H investment policy could solve the optimal
robustness and regulation problems of a nonlinear stochastic
jump diffusion nancial system to achieve a desired target with a
less risk and a less regulation investment effort, simultaneously.
To avoid solving nonlinear system dynamic-constrained MOP,
the TS fuzzy model interpolation method is employed such
that the nonlinear system dynamic constraints can be replaced
by two sets of LMI constraints. If there exist some feasible solu-
tions for the LMI constraints in (20)(22), the LMI-constrained
MOP could be solved easier by the proposed LMI-constrained
MOEA algorithm. Thus, the multiobjective H2/H investment
policy for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial systems
can be solved efciently by the help of the commercial software
MATLAB via LMI toolbox. When the Pareto front is obtained
for Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP in (19), the manager can
select a preferable fuzzy investment policy from the set of Pareto
optimal fuzzy investment policy according to his/her own pref-
erence and nish the multiobjective H2/H investment policy
design of the nonlinear stochastic nancial system. Finally, an
example is given to conrm the satisfactory performance of the
proposed multiobjective H2/H investment policy design for
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion nancial systems through
the computer simulation.
