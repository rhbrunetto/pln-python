Data-Driven Stochastic Pricing and Application

to Electricity Market

Saahil Shenoy, Senior Member, IEEE, and Dimitry Gorinevsky, Fellow, IEEE

AbstractThis paper develops a novel approach to computation
of the probability integrals encountered in derivative pricing
using stochastic models estimated from historical data. First,
nonparametric probability distribution models are built directly
from the data as a solution of a convex optimization problem
scalable to very big datasets. Second, these models are used for
numerical calculus of probability integrals, where the quadrature
includes long tails of the probability distributions. The application
example is the procurement contract in the day-ahead bulk market
for electricity. The data for PJM utility loads and prices in the day-
ahead and spot markets were used to estimate the risk and to price
the contract. The data-driven forward contract pricing allows to
optimize the contract cost and reduce it by 2% compared to the
baseline; this corresponds to about $0.6B/year in potential utility
savings.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HIS paper presents a data-driven probability integral

method for pricing xed-term derivative contracts. The
motivating problem is described next but the method is po-
tentially applicable to many other derivative pricing problems.
We consider a load serving entity (LSE), such as an electrical
distribution utility, that holds a service obligation to supply elec-
tricity at the predetermined hour without restriction on volume
(a load following contract). In the day-ahead forward contract,
the LSE procures the forecasted amount of the electricity from
the wholesale day-ahead market and faces the opportunity cost
of procuring an unknown remaining amount at the contract de-
livery time in a volatile spot market.

The stated problem has special features that call for use of
modern signal processing methods, see [1]. First, the electrical
load and the spot prices are non-Gaussian random variables.
Their distributions are conditional on the known regressor vari-

ables and often have long tails. Second, this is a xed term
problem, which allows to use data-driven models trained on his-
torical data for the past xed term periods. Third, the stochastic
pricing problem involves two interdependent random variables:
the electricity load and the spot price. The electricity load inu-
ence means the contract cannot be priced by arbitrage relative
to the spot price.

The established derivative pricing approaches, such as the
celebrated BlackScholes model, assume normal distributions
of the variables, see [2]. Most derivative pricing approaches for
the electricity market use normal distribution models as well,
e.g., see [3][5].

Closer to the subject of this paper is work on xed term
derivatives, starting from [6], [7], where nonparametric models
of distributions can be estimated directly from the historical
data. In [8], [9], nonparametric models are used for pricing
electricity forward contracts.

The cited work does not include nonparametric modeling of
conditional distributions with many regressor variables. The
electricity markets are more predictable than stock markets.
This allows using more complex models with regressors
including seasonal variables
intra-day
hour), weather variables, and others. An approach known as
quantile regression (QR) is well suited for modeling of such
nonparametric distributions, see [10][13]. The QR distribution
models have been used for derivative pricing, e.g., see [14] and
[15]. The QR models have been also used for electricity data
forecasting, see [16][18]. The QR models are applied to risk
estimation in [13], [19][21].

(monthly, weekly,

Most of the related prior QR work uses kernel regressors, e.g.,
see [22][27]. The nite-support or Gaussian kernels cannot
model the long tails of the probability distribution.

Long tail models have been long used in the actuarial science
approaches to insurance, see [28][30]. The use of the long
tail model in nance has increased in the recent years, e.g., see
[31][34]. With the proliferation of variable wind and solar gen-
eration, the probability distributions in the electricity market are
increasingly non-Gaussian. However, the only prior work using
QR models with long tails in electricity market applications
known to the authors is [16].

The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, it
develops QR non-parametric models of the probability dis-
tributions based on historical data and including long tails.
Second,
these models are extended to two interdependent
variables: the electrical load and the spot price. Third, the paper
shows how to use the developed models for numerical compu-
tation of stochastic integrals in the derivative pricing. Finally, it
demonstrates applications of the methodology to the motivating
example of the load following contracts in the electricity market.

earlier conference papers [35], [36].

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

We consider the dataset

D = {yP ,i, y ,i, Zi}N

i=1,

(1)

where scalars yP ,i and y ,i are response variables, vectors
Zi  (cid:3)n are explanatory variables (regressors), i is the sam-
ple number, and N is the number of the samples.

In the motivating problem of the forward contract pricing,
variable yP ,i describes the amount of the electricity to be pro-
cured in the contract. Variable y ,i describes the future spot
price of the electricity at the delivery time. In what follows, we
assume that data (1) are i.i.d., and follow unknown conditional
multivariate distribution yP , y|Z. In forecasting applications,
i is the time sample and the i.i.d. assumption means the under-
lying process is stationary.
The stochastic pricing requires to estimate the multivariate
probability density p(yP , y|Z). This distribution is used to
compute a stochastic integral of the form

(cid:2)(cid:2) 
 f(yP , y )p(yP , y|Z)dyP dy .

(2)

E[f(yP , y )] =

We consider the class of probability integrals (2) for the func-

tions of the form

f(yP , y ) = (y )  (A(yP )  B)+ ,

(3)
where the notation ()+ = max(, 0) is used; () and () are
two monotonically increasing functions; () is unbounded.
Such integrals are often encountered in derivative pricing, e.g.,
for spread options, see [37].

Let y be the solution to (y) = B/A; for the unbounded
monotonically increasing function , the solution always exists.
The full stochastic integral (2), (3) is now approximated as
E[f(yP , y )] = A  (y|, )  B  (y|, 1),

can be acquired directly from the data. The paper estimates the
non-parametric model and uses it for computing (2).

Fig. 1 overviews the proposed methodology for stochastic
pricing. First, historical data is used for model estimation. The
obtained distribution model is then used in Stochastic Pricing to
compute Contract Pricing (2).

The next sections describe the detail of the approach. The
model estimation is discussed in Section III. Computation of
stochastic pricing (2) is discussed in Section IV. Section V
demonstrates example applications related to the electricity
market.

III. ESTIMATING THE PROBABILISTIC MODEL

The distribution p(yP , y|Z) in (2) is modeled from data
(1) using multiple QR. The non-parametric model provides a
exible description of the distribution shape. The constructed
model can be then used in the stochastic integral. This section
describes the proposed data-driven modeling method.

A. Single Quantile Regression

As a starting point, consider a special case of the dataset D

(1) with one scalar dependent variable yi.

Dqr = {Zi, yi}N

i=1,

(6)

where vectors Zi are the same as in (1). It is assumed the data (6)
are i.i.d. and follow an unknown conditional multivariate dis-
tribution with the probability density function p(y|Zi). We are
trying to estimate the probability density p(y|Zi) from data (6) .
We assume that the distribution p(y|Z) for (6) is described

by the following QR model

P (y  y(q)|Z) = q,

(5)

(7)

where the dependence on the denite integral  on the integrand
functions  and  has been made explicit. The term (y|, 1)
in (4) means that the integral is computed for (yP ) = 1. The
computation of integral (5) for specic functions  and  is
discussed in Section IV-B.
For special case of () = 1, integral (2), (3) is encountered
in the stochastic calculus of pricing options. If we take , () =
1, A = 1, and () = exp() in (3), then f(yP , y ) = (ey P 
B)+ gives pricing of a European call option for the log-price
variable yP and strike price B. If, further, yP follows a Gaussian
distribution, we get the celebrated BlackScholes model [2].
Most of the existing work related to derivatives pricing assumes
Gaussian distributions of the prices.

This paper extends the stochastic integral (2) to a general
non-parametric probability distribution model. Such model of
the joint probability distribution for the amount and the price

(8)
where q  (0, 1) is the quantile level;   (cid:3)n and   (cid:3) are
the QR hyperplane parameters.

y(q) = Z(q) + (q),

For a given q, model (7) can be estimated by solving a LP
(linear programming) problem, see [38]. This LP problem can
be compactly written as

where vector Y = [y1 . . . yN ]T  (cid:3)N 1, matrix Z = [Z1
. . . ZN ]T  (cid:3)N n , and 1N  (cid:3)N is a column vector of ones. In
the case of q = 1/2, QR is the well-known median regression.
Quantile regression (9) uses pinball loss function h(Y ; q) and

provides estimate that differs from the ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression with squared loss (cid:7)Y (cid:7)2
2.

The QR can be used for estimation of the entire generating
distribution in (6). The distribution can be estimated through a
non-parametric model of the cumulative density function
P(y|Z) in (7). The predictive power of such non-parametric
model estimated using QR is limited by two issues. The rst is-
sue is that if there are few data points on one side of the quantile
hyperplane, solution (9) might have very large variance. This
issue is with the distribution tails: the left tail quantile levels
q (cid:8) 1 and the right tail quantile levels, 1  q (cid:8) 1. This issue
is discussed below in Section III-E.

The second issue is that the QR hyperplanes for different
quantiles are generally not parallel to each other. This means
they intersect, at which point the estimated quantiles loose their
ordering. This is known as the quantile crossing problem. The
issue of the quantile crossing is discussed in Section III-D.

B. Multiple Quantile Regression

We need a model of the form (7), where  = (q) and  =
(q) are smooth functions that can be differentiated to compute
the probability density. Solving individual QR problems (9) for
many different values q might not give the desired result. To get
a better solution, we solve a multiple QR problem on the grid
of m quantiles qj

0 < q1 < . . . < qm < 1.

(10)

These multiple QR problems are solved as a joint optimization
problem with a smoothing penalty

where h(Y, q), Y , Z, and 1N are dened in (9);  is a penalty on
the rst difference on j ; , on the second difference of j . The
reasoning behind the introduction of the smoothing penalties and
selection of parameters  and  is presented in Section III-D.
The constraints on j in (11) are introduced because for the low
and the high quantiles there is not enough data on one side of the
hyperplane to get accurate estimates of both regression slope j
and its intercept j . The tail modeling is further discussed in
Section III-E.

C. Solving the Multiple Quantile Regression

Convex optimization problem (11) is a quadratic program-
ming (QP) problem. For small to moderate problem size, it
can be solved with many available QP solvers. Large problem

sizes for large training data sets (6) and large dimension of the
regressor vector Z require a specialized convex optimization
approach. The large problem sizes are encountered in the prac-
tical applications of the described QR modeling methods. A
scalable approach to solving problem (11) is discussed in our
paper [35], where more detail can be found. This convex op-
timization problem can be solved by using the block splitting
formulation of the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) [39]. The ADMM solution is scalable and paralleliz-
able in the number of data points and the number of regressors.
It has been demonstrated for N = 21 696 data points with 4455
decision parameters in [35]. For a problem with N = 106 data
points and 105 decision parameters the solution took 15 minutes
to compute on a quad-core PC.

D. Quantile Crossing Problem

The quantile crossing issue is brought up in the end of Section

III-A. It is examined here in more depth.

The multi-quantile model is obtained by solving (11). The
solution is the set of the slopes j and intercepts j (11) on
the quantile grid (10). This set describes the functions (q) and
(q) in (7). The probability density p(y) = dq
dy can be obtained
by differentiating y = Z + . In practice, a secant method of
differentiation can be employed using j and j .

dy > 0. This is equivalent

to dy

The quantile crossing is avoided if dq
dq > 0, which can be expressed as

Consider the following use case. Model (7) is estimated
(trained) for a set of past data (6). It is then exploited in some
on-line algorithm for new data points. Will quantile crossing
be an issue? The quantile hyperplanes intersect somewhere in
the regressor space, unless (q) is constant. This means one can
always nd a regressor Z such that model has quantile crossing.
Below is a sufcient condition that there is no quantile cross-

ing for a given regressor Z. Taking matrix norms of ZM
and the remaining multiplier in (13), maximizing over q, and
dividing by the second norm yields

computed on the grid (10) to evaluate  in (15). The smoothing
parameters  and  in (11) should be tuned such that condition
(14), holds for all (or almost all) data points. The numerical anal-
ysis of these quantile crossing conditions and of the smoothing
parameter tuning for the problem closely related to the examples
in Section V can be found in [35].

E. Tail Modeling

The described smoothed QR model (7), (8), (10), (11) inter-
polates the available data. The distribution tails, i.e., the extreme
values of response variables y have to be modeled separately.
The stochastic model for the last (or the rst) quantile can be
extrapolated beyond the data range if its parametric form is
known. Extreme value theory (EVT) predicts that in many cases
the distribution tails follow a Pareto (power law) or exponential
distribution [40]. The EVT methods for tail estimation are peaks
over threshold (POT) and the block maxima. This paper uses
the POT method because it employs all data in the last (or the
rst) quantile.

The application examples of Section V, use log-variables. In
log-coordinates, the Pareto distribution becomes an exponential
distribution. The exponential tails can be estimated as a separate
step, after the solution to (11) has been computed. The rst
qL = q1 and the last qR = qm quantile levels on the quantile
grid in (10) are used as the tail thresholds. The POT exceedances
are

eL ,j = yj  Zj 1  1,
eR ,k = yk  Zk m  m ,
JL  {j : yj < Zj 1 + 1}

j  JL ,

and

We assume the tail probability distributions to be
Z1 + 1  y|y < Z1 + 1  Exp(L ),
y  Zm  m|y > Zm + m  Exp(R ).

(16)

(17)

These distributions are conditional on the POT exceedance
events in (18) and (19), which have probabilities qL =
P(y < Z1 + 1) and qR = P(y < Zm + m ). The Maxi-
mum Likelihood Estimates of the tail rate parameters L in (18)
and R in (19) are

L = mean(eL ,j|j  JL),

F. Quantile Model of the Distribution
The numerical calculation of the stochastic integral (2) re-
quires expressing the probability density p(y|Z) through the
data-driven probabilistic model of the form (7), (8), (10), (11),
(18), (19).
Model (7) denes the cumulative density function (CDF):
P (y  y(q)|Z) = Fy|Z (y) = q. Model (8) can be then consid-
1
y|Z (q), where
ered as the inverse CDF (quantile function) y = F
q is the quantile level.

The QR model (8), (11) is estimated at the quantile grid points
(10). We extended this model to the entire (0, 1) quantile interval

as

y(s|Z) =

m(cid:5)

j=1

(Zj + j )Kj (s),

(22)

where kernel functions Kj (s) are such that Kj (qj ) = 1, and
Kj (qk ) = 0 for k (cid:11)= j. Model (22) does linear interpolation
between the grid nodes (10) and extrapolation for the tails in
accordance with (18), (19). We use

Kj (s) = Bj,2(s)

for qR < s < 1,

(23)

(24)

(25)

where Bj,2(s) are the second-order (triangular) B-spline kernels
with knots (10). The log terms in (24) and (25) come from
the quantile functions (inverse CDFs) of the tail exponential
distributions (18) and (19).

G. Bivariate Distribution in Quantile Variables
The bivariate distribution p(yP , y|Z) in (2) can be expressed
using the conditional probability formula

p(yP , y|Z) = p(y|Z, yP )  p(yP |Z).

(26)
We model p(y|Z, yP ) and p(yP |Z) through the respective
inverse CDFs of the form (22)(25). The inverse CDF model
for p(yP |Z) can be expressed as

yP (s|Z) =

m(cid:5)

j=1

(ZP ,j + P ,j )Kj (s),

(27)

where the model parameters for yP , such as P ,j and P ,j , are
obtained according to (8), (10), (11), (18), (19).
The inverse CDF model for p(y|Z, yP ) in (26) explicitly de-
pends on yP , which is an additional regressor parameter. Similar
to quantile model (27), we have

m(cid:5)

y (r|Z, yP ) =

(Z ,j +  ,j yP +  ,j )Kj (r).

IV. NUMERICAL STOCHASTIC INTEGRATION

This section presents a method for numerical computation of
the stochastic integral (5) using the nonparametric probability
distribution model of the form (27), (28). In this section the
regression variable vector Z is given and xed. Therefore, the
explicit dependence on Z is omitted to make the explanation
clearer.

A. Probability Integral Transform

Models (27), (28) expressed in terms of the quantile levels
allow to formulate integral (5) using the probability integral
transform. The joint pdf in (5) can be expressed through quantile

B. Numerical Integration Approach
The evaluation of (q) in (5) is illustrated in Table I that
shows partitioning of the 2-D [0, 1]  [0, 1] integration domain
into nine subdomains. The double integral (q) is a sum of the
integrals over these subdomains, which are annotated in Table I.
The middle block in Table I does not include singularities and
can be computed using numerical quadrature. For simplicity,
assume that the same uniform quantile grid of the form (10) is
used for building both models (27) and (28), where qj  qj1 =

For q  qR , we have (q) = 0.
When computing integral (4), special care should be taken
of the distribution tails that correspond to the eight edge blocks
in Table I. Functions  (27) and  (28) include logarithms at
the integration domain edges that have singularities at 0 and 1
respectively. These logarithmic singularities describe the quan-
tile behavior of the exponential distribution tails. Because of the
singularities, the integrals for all eight edge blocks in Table I are
not amenable to the numerical quadrature and must be computed
analytically. The obtained analytical expressions for the eight
edge block integrals given below can be used in the numerical
computation of integral (4). Each of the eight tail integrals de-
pends on the tail behaviors for the two the integration variables,
q and r, and on the inner integral limit q in (34).

The tail integrals for the eight edge blocks can be expressed

through the following auxiliary functions

Integrals (38)(45) can be evaluated for specic functions

(r, q) and (q). This is done below.

C. Tail Integrals for Exponential Function

In the motivating example of Section V, logarithms of the
variables yP and y are used in the estimated model. Computing
the expectation of the forward contract price in (3) requires the
inverse, exponential, transformations. This means in (32), (33)
we have

(y ) = exp(  y ),
(yP ) = exp(  yP ),

where  and  are xed exponent parameters.

Auxiliary functions (38)(41) are then computed as

L (r, q) = e(r, qL , min(q, qL ), qL , L ),
R (r, q) = e(r, qR , max(qR , q), 1,R ),

gL(q) = (rL , q)h(rL ,  L ),
gR (q) = (rR , q)h(1  rR , R ),

where

L = ( (r) + )/P L ,

R = ( (r) + )/P R ,

e (r, q, q, a, ) = (r, q)  (q)

 m(q)  |m(a) + 1  m(q) + 1|/( + 1),

h(r, ) = r/ (1 + /) ,
m(x) = min(x, 1  x),

and  (r) in (56), (57) is dened through (23), (25) as

m(cid:5)

 (r) =

 ,j  Kj (r).

j=1

The tail integrals (42)(45) in Table I are

FL ,L(q) = L (rL , q)  h(rL ,  L ),
FL ,R (q) = L (rL , q)  h(1  rR , R ),
FR ,L(q) = R (rL , q)  h(rL ,  L ),
FR ,R (q) = R (rL , q)  h(1  rR , R ).

Integrals (46)(49) in Table I are expressed through L in (52)
and R in (53). To evaluate (q; , 1) in the case of  = 1 one
can set  = 0 in (51), (56), and (57).

V. APPLICATION EXAMPLES

The motivating example for this paper is the stochastic pricing
of the day-ahead electricity procurement contracts entered by a
distribution utility. We consider the following stylized problem.
The distribution utility is buying electrical power at the advance
bulk electricity market. This happens every midnight, when the
utility enters into 24 forward contracts for each hour of the next
24-hour day. As the day goes on, at each hour, the utility must
fulll the aggregate demand of the retail customers. This power
load demand is unknown in advance. Possible shortages of the
forward contract are lled by procuring the decit amount at
the spot electrical power market, which can be rather volatile.
If the forward contract provides a surplus of the power, the
overpayment cannot be recovered.

This section applies the developed methodology to a few
problems related to the described day-ahead electricity pro-
curement setup. Section V-A applies the modeling approach of
Section III to data sets for a major US utility, PJM. The result is
the data-driven stochastic models for the power loads and spot
prices. The obtained models allow using the numerical stochas-
tic pricing approach of Section IV for the forward contract
pricing. As a simple example of the method usage, Section V-C
evaluates the risk of the forward contract in fullling the power
load demand. Section V-D provides forward contract pricing for
a given hour of the day. This contract pricing is then applied to
demonstrate procurement policy optimization in Section V-E.

A. Model for Day-Ahead Forward Contract

Let Pt be the load demand and t the spot price at hour t. The
response variables yP ,t and y ,t in the dataset (1) are indexed
by the number of hours t elapsed since the start of the data
collection and are

yP ,t = log (Pt/P0) ,
y ,t = log (t/0) ,

(66)

(67)

where the log-load is normalized by P0 = 1 GW and the log-
price by 0 = $1/MWh. Regressors Zt in (66), (67) include
6 indicators for week days, 11 for calendar months, and 3 for
holidays, as well as 24-hour lagged log-load and log-spot price
for a total of 23 regressors. For more discussion on the regressors
see [35], [36].

This work uses a data set from the PJM utility, which is
described in [41], [42]. The total system load Pt is used in
the examples below. The range of the loads is 51 to 158 GW,
with the average load of 88 GW. The data covers a time range
from January 2011 to December 2013 with sampling interval of
one hour, N = 26 280 samples at all. The dataset also includes
the spot electricity prices. The prices range from $0/MWh to
$768/MWh, with the average around $37/MWh. The price is
sampled at an hourly rate, the same as the load. We split up
the dataset into two parts, the training and test set. The training
set includes the data from January 2011 to December 2012, the
total of 17 520 samples. It is used to estimate the data-driven
stochastic models of Section III for the log power loads and
log spot prices. The test set from January 2013 to December

2013, which contains 8760 time samples, is used for validat-
ing the model Section V-B and the model-based policies in
Sections V-C and V-E.

The data-driven methods of Section III were applied to
estimate two probabilistic models from the data: the model
of the form (27) for the log load yP ,t (66) and the model (28) for
the log price y ,t (67). The models use quantile grid (10) with
m = 99 and spacing q = 0.01 spanning from qL = rL = 0.01
to qR = rR = 0.99.

Selection of smoothing parameters  and  is discussed in
Section III-D. More detail on parameter tuning for a closely
related application example can be found in [35]. In both data
t problems (11), for (66) and (67), the smoothing parameters
were set to  = 5  105,  = 5  105 for 2, 3, and 6-hour ahead
forecasts and  = 106,  = 5  105 for all other hours. Cross
validation of these parameters based on Pearsons chi square
test statistics is discussed in Section V-B.

Fig. 2 illustrates overall modeling logic. The model training
is based on Data Set (6), which is the input into the optimal
t of smoothed QR procedure (11). The output is distribution
model on quantile grid (10) described by quantile regression
parameters {j , j}m
j=1 in (11), and tail rate parameters (20)
and (21).

The t of the estimated models (27), (28) is illustrated by us-
ing them for forecasting the data in the training dataset. Overall,
24 models of the form (27) for the log loads at each of the 24
hours of the next day were estimated along with the 24 models
of the form (28) for the log prices. At each midnight point, fore-
casts for the next 24 hours were computed and then compared
to the actually realized values.

Fig. 3 illustrates the load forecasts for a 101 hour segment
(just over 4 days) computed for quantile levels q = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9
in the models of the form (27), (66). The 24 hourly forecasts
for the 24 trained models are stitched together in the gure. The
actual load demand curve is plotted along with the quantile level
forecasts.

Fig. 4 illustrates the quantile forecasts for the spot prices. The

format is the same as in Fig. 3.

B. Statistical Validation of the Model
After the probability integral transform (31), the original dis-
tribution (26) becomes a uniform distribution in [0, 1]  [0, 1]
square in the quantile variables (q, r), see [43]. Following
[43], [44], the statistical validation of the estimate of distribution
(26) is equivalent to testing the uniform distribution hypothesis
in the transformed variables (q, r). This is done by dividing the
[0, 1]  [0, 1] square into 100 cells of 0.1  0.1 size. Each cell
has a probability mass of 0.01.

Fig. 5 shows percentages of the test set data points in the 100
quantile cells for the estimated 20-hours ahead forecast model.
As expected, the results are around 1% (the average of 3.65 data
points). The Pearsons chi-squared test of the goodness of t
can be computed for the binned data in Fig. 5 with 99 degrees of
freedom, e.g., see [43], [44]. The test does not reject the uniform
distribution hypothesis with signicance of 99%.

The chi-squared test results for all estimated models are
shown in Fig. 6. The dashed line shows the 99% critical value
of the distribution. The bars show the chi-squared statistics for
the 24 forecast hours. They are all below the dashed line, which
means the null hypothesis holds. These are results for the test set
with the model estimated from the training set. The chi-squared
statistics for the training set are substantially smaller.

The ISO ensures that the generation capacity for the power
procured by the utility is available with a 10% operating reserve
margin. If the actual demand exceeds the operating reserve, it
cannot be fully satised, no matter the price. This means some
hard load must be shed, which is called a loss of load (LOL)
event. The risk of the LOL events is controlled by the regulator,
NERC. The LOL expectation is required to be less than of 1 day
in 10 years, which corresponds to LOL probability (LOLP) of
less than 0.00027.

t =
In accordance with (66), the reserved capacity is P
1.1  P0 exp(yP ,t). The risk of the LOL event is Rt = P(yP ,t >
log 1.1 + yP ,t|Zt). It can be estimated using formula (4) and
stochastic integral (5), where (r, q) = 1, (q) = 1, A = 1,
B = 0, and y = log 1.1 + yP ,t. The parts of integral (34)
shown in Table I can be computed in accordance with (35),
(42)(45), and (46)(49), (52), (53), where  = 1 is obtained
by setting  = 0 in (50) and  = 1 for  = 0 in (51). Alterna-
tively, the risk Rt can be obtained from the numerical quantile
model yP (s|Z) (27); Rt = 1  st, where st is a solution to
yP (st|Zt) = log 1.1 + yP ,t.
To illustrate the risk estimation, 24 risk values are computed at
each midnight for the 24 OLS forecasts for each hour of the next
day. Forecast for each hour is using its own OLS model (68),
(69) for the log loads yP . The model is trained based on the data
set described in Section V-A. The risk estimates for 24 hours
of each day in the training dataset have been stitched together
to provide coverage for each hour of the data. Fig. 8 shows risk
Rt computed for a 101 hour (about 4-day) segment of the data.
The minimum of the risk estimate is less than 105 and mostly
less than 0.01. This means evaluation of the risk relies on the
tail part of the data-driven probabilistic model of Section V-A.
The horizontal dashed line in Fig. 8 is the LOLP = 0.00027
mandated by NERC. One can see that the common approach
of using the OLS forecast plus 10% margin does not provide
the required LOLP at all times. Fig. 8 shows that using the
OLS forecast provides average log-risk that looks reasonable;
however the average risk is much higher than the required LOLP.

Fig. 7. QQ plots for the right tails: load (left), spot price (right).

Figs. 5 and 6 characterize the goodness of t of models (27)
and (28) for the distribution body. The distribution tails describe
rare extreme events that are not seen in these gures and not
covered by the tests. The exponential model t for the right tails
of quantile functions (27) and (28) in log-variables (66), (67)
is illustrated by the QQ plots in Fig. 7. The errors of the 8am
(8-hour ahead) forecast for the training set are plotted. The QQ
plots show that the tail models t the data very well. These log-
exponential (Pareto) models have the best t by far compared
to the alternatives. More discussion on selecting and estimating
tail distribution models for electrical load and price data, as well
as further references can be found in [33], [35], [45].

C. Forward Contract Risk Estimation

The models built in Section V-A can be used for estimating
the risk of the forward contract for electricity delivery. The prob-
abilistic evaluation of risk is important because load volatility
is increasing with the on-going proliferation of the renewable
generation. The most important risk factor is that the required
amount of the electricity cannot be procured at the spot market,
because the stand-by generation capacity is insufcient.

Consider a stylized formulation, which resembles empirical
approach used by some ISOs (independent systems operators)
for operational provisioning of the generating capacity, see [46].
Assume that power amount in the day-ahead electricity procure-
ment contract is determined by utility using the OLS forecast of
the form similar to (8)

yP ,t = ZtOLS + OLS ,

(68)

SHENOY AND GORINEVSKY: DATA-DRIVEN STOCHASTIC PRICING AND APPLICATION TO ELECTRICITY MARKET

1037

An alternative approach is to use the data-driven probabilistic
model (27), (28) described in Section V-A to achieve the risk
Rt = r = 0.00027 at all times by using QR forecast yP ,t =
yP (r|Zt). This risk corresponds to the horizontal dashed line
in Fig. 8.

D. Forward Contract Pricing

In this section,

the data-driven probabilistic model of
Section V-A is used for forward pricing of the electricity pro-
curement contract.

We consider the day-ahead forward contract entered at the
midnight for the electricity delivery at given hour t of the next
day. With the regressor vector Zt known, the conditional quan-
tile models of the form yP (q) (27) for log-load (66) and of the
form y (r) (28) for the log-prices (67) can be used. The quantile
model (27) and inverse of (66) can be used to parametrize the
advance power order Pa(t) though a quantile level variable s as
Pa(t) = P0ey P (s). Note that s  Pa(t) is a one-to-one trans-
formation since both (27) and (66) are monotonic functions.

The forward contract cost Ct depends on the future log-load
yP ,t and log-spot price y ,t, which are both random variables.
Its expectation can be expressed as

(cid:3)(cid:15)

E[Ct(s)] = E

P0ey P , t  P0ey P (s)

(cid:16)

(cid:4)

0ey  , t

.

(70)

+

To compute expected forward contract cost (70), we need
to evaluate stochastic integral (2) with exponential functions
(50), (51) in integrand function f(yP ,t, y ,t) (3). Integral (70) is
obtained by setting A = P0, B = P0ey P (s) in (3) and  =  = 1
in (50), (51). We then used formulas (4) and (5). The parts of
integral (34) shown in Table I were evaluated in accordance with
(35), (42)(45), (46)(49), (52), (53).

E. Contract Cost Optimization

The forward contract pricing in Section V-D can be used
as a basis for optimizing the procurement policy. This section
considers optimization of the total expected cost that is the sum
of the advance cost and the expected forward contract price.
These costs depend on the advance power order Pa(t).

The advance cost is the deterministic value adv,t1Pa(t).
Using the same quantile parametrization as in Section V-D, we
have

At(s) = adv,t1P0ey P , t (s),

(71)

where adv,t is the advance price at time t. The advance price
data from PJM utility is described in [42]. The advance prices
range between $0/MWh and $313/MWh, with the average of
$37/MWh.

The total cost Tt(s) at a given time t is

Tt(s) = At(s) + E[Ct(s)],

(72)
where the expected forward contract cost E[Ct(s)] (70) is com-
puted as the stochastic integral, see Section V-D. Based on (71),
the advance cost At(s) is a non-decreasing function of s. The
expected spot cost E[Ct(s)] is a non-increasing positive func-
tion of s. The optimal trade-off between the advance cost and

the spot cost that minimizes total cost Tt(s) (72) can be found
numerically by computing Tt(s) on a grid of quantile levels
s  (0, 1).

Fig. 9 illustrates the total cost Tt(s) for 12 pm on July 19,
2013 computed from E[Ct(s)] (70), At(s) (71), and (72) on
the grid of the quantile levels s. Its minimum is achieved near
so = 0.81. For s < so, Tt(s) is dominated by E[Ct(s)] and for
s > s, by At(s).

In backtesting, the historical data ahead in time of the contract
allows computing the actual realized cost for an advance log-
power procurement yP ,t as

(cid:6)

(cid:7)

ey P , t  ey P , t

(73)

+

Ut(yP ,t) = adv,tP0ey P , t + tP0

where yP ,t is the actual log power load that realized at the
contract exercise time. We compute the actual realized cost
Ut for the procured log power yP ,t = yP (so(t)), where so(t)
minimizes the total cost Tt(s) in (72). We compare it with the
results for the baseline advance procurement policy yP ,t = yP ,t
that is based on the OLS forecast (68), (69). The comparison
of these two actual realized costs is summarized in Table II.
The optimized actual realized cost Ut(yP (so)) shows 1.11%
savings, which is $153,000 for the chosen hour.

We backtest

the optimized procurement policy yP ,t =
yP (so(t)) and the baseline OLS forecast procurement policy
yP ,t = yP ,t. The two actual realized costs (73) are computed for
each hour of the test set (the year of 2013). Fig. 10 illustrates
the backtesting logic.

The backtesting results are shown in Fig. 11 for a selected 61
hour period (about 1.5 days). It can be seen that most of the time
the optimized policy has lower cost than the OLS forecast policy.
Fig. 11 shows that main savings come at the peak load times.
This is because the developed non-parametric model describes
the tails much more accurately than the normal distribution
model implied in the OLS. The full year actual cost results are
summarized in Table III. The yearly savings are 2.08% or $641
million for the utility.

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper has developed a numerical stochastic pricing
method for forward procurement contracts using non-parametric
long tail probabilistic models acquired directly from historical
data. The method has been demonstrated in application to elec-
tricity procurement in day-ahead bulk markets. One example
is risk estimation, another example is forward contract pricing
and optimization. Backtesting of the optimized policy based on
the developed data-driven method using electric utility data has
demonstrated savings of 2.08% or $641 million.
