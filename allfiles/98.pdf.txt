Option Pricing With Application of Levy Processes
and the Minimal Variance Equivalent Martingale

Measure Under Uncertainty

Piotr Nowak and Micha Pawowski

AbstractThis paper is dedicated to European option pricing
under assumption that the underlying asset follows a geometric
Levy process. The log-price of a primary nancial instrument has
the form of a sum of a drift component, a Brownian component,
and a linear combination of time-homogeneous Poisson processes,
modeling jumps in price. In our approach we apply stochastic
analysis, especially the change of probability measure techniques,
as well as fuzzy sets theory. To obtain the option valuation formulas
we use the minimal variance equivalent martingale measure, which
requires an advanced analysis of transformation of Levy charac-
teristic triplets. We obtain analytical option valuation expressions
in crisp case. Moreover, we assume that some model parameters
are described in an imprecise way and therefore we use their fuzzy
counterparts. Applying fuzzy arithmetic, we take into account var-
ious types of uncertainty on the market. As a result, we obtain
the analytical option pricing formulas with fuzzy parameters. We
also propose a method of automatized decision making, which uti-
lizes the fuzzy valuation formulas. Apart from the general pricing
expressions, we provide numerical examples to illustrate our theo-
retical results.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE traditional BlackScholes model [1] is a cornerstone

of nancial mathematics, especially the theory of option
pricing. In this model, the authors assume that the underlying
asset prices evolve in continuous time and they are described by
a geometric Brownian motion S. The main advantages of their
approach are the closed analytical European option valuation
expression [2] and the completeness of the BlackScholes -
nancial market model. Along with these benets, the mentioned
approach also has various drawbacks. Inter alia, in contradiction
to theoretical assumptions concerning normality of distribution
of log-returns of S, they are leptokurtic and skewed to the left
[3] on the real market. In addition, the volatility smile is a widely
known empirical phenomenon [4], [5].

Many improvements and alternatives for the BlackScholes
model have been proposed in the nancial literature. Applica-
tion of various types of Levy processes for description of log-
prices of underlying assets is an important research trend in the
theory of option pricing. Since the literature concerning the men-
tioned applications of Levy models is very rich, we only recall
several interesting examples. Merton [6] proposed the sum of a
drifted Brownian motion and a compound Poisson process with
jump sizes following the normal distribution as the log-price
process, assuming simultaneously that jump risk is not system-
atic. In [7] and [8], the European and path-dependent options
applying a jump diffusion model with the asymmetric double
exponential distribution of jump magnitudes were priced. A
further development of this approach was presented in [9][14].
Very known and popular are pure jump Levy models: the nor-
mal inverse Gaussian model proposed in [15] and the variance
gamma model considered in [16].

In the primary nancial instrument model proposed in this
paper we take into account the fact that the asset price is subject
to jumps. Our log-price model Y is a Levy process, which is a
sum of a drifted Brownian motion and a linear combination of
Poisson processes modeling jumps in the nancial instrument
prices. In order to derive the option pricing formulas, we use
stochastic analysis and fuzzy sets theory.

Within stochastic analysis, application of the martingale the-
ory to pricing derivatives is very important in our considera-
tions. We apply minimal variance equivalent martingale measure
(MVEMM), described by Miyahara in [17], as the equivalent
martingale measure. MVEMM, similarly as other minimal dis-
tance martingale measures, appears when the utility-function-
based martingale measure is studied [17]. Therefore, the applied
measure is important for applications. Apart from the martin-
gale measure, Levy characteristic triplets [18] are used to derive
the arbitrage-free prices of the European options.

As we have noted, we also use some elements of fuzzy sets
theory [19], especially the extension principle and fuzzy arith-
metic. Very often it is unreasonable to choose market parameters
as crisp numbers and estimate them with the application of sta-
tistical methods, since their future uctuation is possible [20]. In
our approach we take into consideration the mentioned type of
uncertainty, transferring experts opinions into fuzzy numbers
and introducing them to the model in the form of fuzzy param-
eters. Obtaining triangular fuzzy parameters based on experts
opinions was proposed, e.g., in [21], where another nancial

problem was studied. In this paper, apart from the fuzzy op-
tion pricing formulas, we propose an automatized method of
decision making based on the derived fuzzy prices.

A fuzzy approach to stochastic pricing models, similar to the
one proposed in this paper, was applied in the case of the tra-
ditional BlackScholes model in [20] and [22]. An interesting
method of option pricing was considered by Yoshida in [23],
who assumed the geometric Brownian motion as the model of a
primary nancial instrument and used the rational expected op-
tion price, depending on a fuzzy goal. A jump-diffusion model
was used for vulnerable options pricing in a fuzzy environment
in [24]. Fuzzy reload option pricing problem was considered in
[25]. In [26], fuzzy estimators for the volatility of stock returns,
based on condence intervals, were applied to option pricing.
Thiagarajah et al. [27] used adaptive fuzzy numbers to model
the uncertainty of volatility in the BlackScholes model. An in-
teresting and useful approach to option valuation is generalized
hybrid fuzzy-stochastic binomial American real option model
considered in [28]. Fuzzy methods of option pricing were also
developed by other authors [29], [30].

In this paper, similarly as in [31] and [32], we extended the
method of option pricing under uncertainty, applied by Wu [20],
[22] in the case of the classical BlackScholes framework, by
introducing jumps to the model of underlying asset prices. The
main contribution of this paper is the adaptation of MVEMM in
the martingale method of pricing in place of Esscher transformed
and minimal entropy martingale measures considered in the
previous papers. This leads to a new form of the European
option pricing formulas in the crisp case which, to the best of our
knowledge, were not published yet. Moreover, in comparison
to [31] and [32], we describe the fuzzy option prices in a more
detailed way, deriving the forms of their -level sets as functions
of -level sets of the model parameters. Moreover, the proposed
automatized decision-making method can be a useful tool for
nancial analysts. In the numerical part of this paper several
sample market situations are investigated and, based on them,
appropriate automatized recommendations are suggested. What
is more, the membership function of the fuzzy option price is
calculated and the sensitivity analysis of the price with regard
to the volatility of the underlying instrument is performed.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II is dedicated
to denitions and facts from fuzzy sets theory. In Section III,
we present some elements of stochastic analysis, including the
MVEMM. In Section IV, we derive and prove the European call
and put option pricing formulas, by using MVEMM. Section V
is devoted to the valuation of European options in fuzzy envi-
ronment. An automatized method of nancial decision making
is proposed in Section VI. In Section VII, we present numer-
ical examples to illustrate the previously obtained theoretical
results. Section VIII contains details of application of the pro-
posed method in nance. In Section IX, we present concluding
remarks and future possible direction of our studies.

II. FUZZY ARITHMETICBASIC DEFINITIONS AND FACTS
For a fuzzy subset A of the set of real numbers R, we use the
: R  [0, 1]

symbol  A to denote its membership function  A

 } to denote the -level set
and the symbol A = {x :  A
of A for   (0, 1]. Additionally, A0 denotes the closure of the
set {x :  A
A fuzzy number a is a fuzzy subset of R, with membership
function a , such that

1) a is normal, i.e., there exists a real number x0 for which

(cid:5)= 0}.

a(x0) = 1;

of R.

2) a is upper semicontinuous;
3) a

is quasi-concave,

(a(x), a(y)), for all x, y  R and   [0, 1];

i.e., a(x + (1  )y)  min
4) the zero-level set a0 of the number a is a compact subset
For each   [0, 1], the -level set a of a fuzzy number a
has the form of a bounded closed interval a = [aL
] [33].
We denote the -eld of Borel subsets of R by B (R) and the
We call a fuzzy-number-valued map X :  (cid:6) F (R), where

set of all fuzzy numbers by F (R).
(,F) is a measurable space, a fuzzy random variable if

for every   [0, 1] (see [34] for further details).

We recall basic facts concerning the arithmetic of fuzzy
numbers. We denote the binary operators between fuzzy num-
bers, corresponding to standard operators +,,, / of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division between crisp real num-
bers by the symbols , (cid:8), , and (cid:10), respectively. Let (cid:11) and 
be an operator between fuzzy numbers and the corresponding
to (cid:11) operator between crisp real numbers, respectively. By the
extension principle [35], for each a, b  F (R) the membership
function of a (cid:11) b is described by the formula:
min{a(x), b

(y)} .

(z) =

a(cid:11)b

sup

(1)

(x,y ):xy =z

We assume that zero does not belong to the support of b in
a (cid:10) b. This assumption will be satised for all the operations of
division in this paper.
We denote a binary operator int, (cid:8)int, int or (cid:10)int between
closed intervals [a, b] and [c, d] by the symbol (cid:11)int. If  is
corresponding to (cid:11)int standard operator between the crisp real
numbers (i.e., +,, or /), then
[a, b] (cid:11)int [c, d] = {z  R : z = x  y,x  [a, b] y[c, d]}

under the assumption that the interval [c, d] does not contain
zero in the case of the interval operator of division.

In the further part of this paper, for each fuzzy number a we
will denote the product (1)  a by a .

The following proposition, quoted from [20], will be very

useful in our pricing method.
Proposition 1: Let f be an R-valued function such that
{x  R : f(x) = y} is a compact set for each y  R. Then, the
function f induces a fuzzy-valued function f : F (R)  F (R)
via the extension principle [35]. Moreover, for each   F (R)
= {f(x) :
the -level set of f() satises the equality f()
x  }.
In this paper, we will use L-R fuzzy numbers and triangular



fuzzy numbers.

A fuzzy number a is called a triangular fuzzy number if its

membership function has the following form:





x  a1
a2  a1
x  a3
a2  a3
0,

a(x) =

The interval [a1, a3] is called the supporting interval. The num-
ber a2 is called the modal value of a. The triangular fuzzy
number a will be denoted by

a = (a1, a2, a3).

We apply triangular fuzzy numbers in our numerical anal-
ysis of fuzzy pricing formula for the European option (see
Section VII-C).
Let L, R : [0, 1]  [0, 1] be continuous strictly decreasing
functions such that L(0) = R(0) = 1, L(1) = R(1) = 0. An
L-R fuzzy number a is a fuzzy number with the membership

III. STOCHASTIC PRELIMINARIES

This section is devoted to Levy processes and the problem
of change of probability measure for option pricing. We intro-
duce some notations and recall necessary denitions and facts
concerning stochastic analysis in continuous time, including the
martingale method of pricing.

Let (,F, (Ft)
space. For an arbitrary probability measure M on (,F), we

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 2, APRIL 2017

will denote the expected value with respect to M by EM . In
particular, EP will be the expectation with respect to P .

A stochastic process H = (Ht)

t[0,T ] is called cadlag, if al-
most all its sample paths are right continuous and limited from
the left at every point.
A stochastic process H is called (Ft)-adapted [or adapted to
the ltration (Ft)] if for each t  [0, T ] the random variable Ht
is measurable with respect to the -eld Ft.
A probability measure Q on (,F) is equivalent to P if for
each A  F P (A) = 0 if and only if Q (A) = 0.

We assume that the risk-free spot interest rate is constant and
we denote it by r. We use a cadlag stochastic process St, adapted
to the ltration (Ft), as the underlying assets price process. As
a consequence, the discounted underlying assets price process
is given by

Zt = e

r tSt, t  [0, T ].

(4)

In order to price a nancial derivative one should nd a proba-
bility measure Q equivalent to P , called a martingale measure
of St, for which the discounted price process Zt is a martingale.
Then, the price of a nancial derivative with a payment function
 is described by the equality

Ct = exp (r(T  t)) EQ ( (S)|Ft) , t  [0, T ] .

(5)
A cadlag stochastic process Y = (Yt)
t[0,T ], Y0 = 0 a.s., is
called a Levy process if it is adapted to the ltration (Ft) and
fullls the conditions:
1) it is stochastically continuous, i.e., for each t  [0, T ] and

random variable Yts have the same distributions.

2) for each 0  s  t  T , the increment Yt  Ys is inde-
3) for each 0  s  t  T , the increment Yt  Ys and the
JacodGrigelionis characteristic triplet (Bt, Ct , t), dened
for semimartingales, has many applications in stochastic analy-
sis. In particular, the semimartingale characteristics, which are
stochastic processes, are used in mathematical nance. Their
denition for real-valued semimartingales can be found in [18]
and [36]. We also refer the reader to [37], where character-
istic triplet (Bt, Ct, t) was dened for quasi-left continuous
semimartingales in the Hilbert space-valued case. For a Levy
process Y , they have a deterministic form dened below (for
details see, e.g., [18]).
Let a truncation function hd have the form hd (x) = xI|x|d
for a positive constant d. We will use the symbol M(R) to
denote the space of all nonnegative measures on R.
For each t  [0, T ] the characteristic function t() of Yt,
where Y = (Yt)
t[0,T ] is an arbitrary Levy process, has the
following form:

the value of b depends on the parameter d of the truncation
function hd.
Formula (6), describing the characteristic function of Yt for
each t  [0, T ], is called the LevyKhintchine formula. The
triplet (Bt, Ct , t) is the triplet of characteristics of the process
Y . Thus, the LevyKhintchine formula describes the charac-
teristic function of a Levy process in terms of the triplet of
its characteristics. To shorten notation, we will use the gener-
as the representation of characteristics
ating triplet
(Bt, Ct , t), assuming that d = 1. It was proved in [17] that Y
is uniquely determined by

N (dt, dx), and N (dt, dx) = N (dt, dx)  N (dt, dx).
The Poisson random measure N (dt, dx) in the LevyIto de-
composition is the jump measure of Y and it is dened for each
Borel subset B of [0, T ]  R by the equality [38]:
N (B) = #{(t, Yt  Yt)  B} .
The intensity measure of N (dt, dx) is N (dt, dx).

lying asset will have the form (11). Additionally, we assume
that F = F T and for t  [0, T ]

Ft =  (Su , u  [0, t]) .

We dene the class of minimal distance martingale measures,
considered in [17]. This class of probability measures is very
important in mathematical nance, similarly as the class of mea-
sures obtained by the Esscher transformation.

where W is a Brownian motion, N (dt, dx) is the Poisson ran-
dom measure described by (10), and ft, gt = g (t, x), t  [0, T ]
are two predictable processes such that the right-hand side of
(12) is well dened. Then, we denote by QL(f ,g) the equivalent
probability measure given by the equality

dQL(f ,g)

dP

|Ft = Lt (f, g) , t  [0, T ]

dP

|Ft denotes the RadonNikodym
where the symbol dQL ( f , g )
density of QL(f ,g) with respect to P restricted to the -eld
Ft.
Let C be the set of pairs (f, g) of predictable processes
t[0,T ] and gt = g(t, x), t  [0, T ], such that the follow-

IV. PRICING WITH CRISP PARAMETERS

The martingale method of pricing under the assumption of the
absence of arbitrage on the market [39] is one of the most com-
monly used techniques in mathematical nance. To price Euro-
pean options we apply this method, assuming that the equivalent
martingale measure is MVEMM.

We assume that all the stochastic processes and random vari-
ables considered below are dened on the ltered probability
space (,F, (Ft)t[0,T ], P), described in the previous section.
Let D be a positive integer. We assume that the underlying asset
price is driven by the geometric Levy process St described by
(11), where the process Yt has the following form:
+ 

Yt = t + Wt + k1N  1

+ k2N  2

N  1
are Poisson processes with constant inten-
t
sities 1 > 0, 2 > 0, . . . , D > 0. Furthermore, all the pro-
cesses describing Y are independent. It is easy to verify that
k1, k2, . . . , kD are the heights of jumps of the process Y .

Let N

pendent random variables taking values kj with probabilities
 for j = 1, 2, . . . , D. The following lemma shows that

V. PRICING WITH FUZZY PARAMETERS

In this section, we will derive fuzzy versions of the previ-
ously obtained European option pricing formulas. Introducing
fuzzy parameters to the model enables consideration of uncer-
tainties which arise from the estimation of their crisp values. To
obtain values of the introduced parameters we can utilize the
knowledge of experts. Our approach in this paper is general and
arbitrary L-R fuzzy numbers can be used as the fuzzy parame-
ters. However, in many situations we can obtain from an expert
(often in the best-case scenario) only three numbers concern-
ing the parameter: its smallest value, its greatest value, and the
value, which is most likely to occur. One can transfer the three-
mentioned values into a triangular fuzzy number (p1, p2, p3).
If more experts opinions are available, one can transfer them
into a sequence of triangular fuzzy numbers (p
i=1,

(i)
3 )N

(i)
1 , p

(i)
2 , p

where N > 1 is the number of experts and compute their

to obtain the parameter estimate. Such a method of estimation
was used in [21] and [40] for nancial applications. Thus, al-
though in our approach the introduced fuzzy parameters can
have the form of arbitrary L-R fuzzy numbers, in many practical
situations they can be asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. We
will write the symbol  above them to indicate the fuzziness of
the considered fuzzy parameters. The parameters without  will
be treated as crisp numbers. An approach similar to ours can be
found in [20].
In particular, we assume that the interest rate r and the under-
lying asset model parameters , , k = {ki}D
i=1 ,  = {i}D
i=1
are not precisely known. We replace them with L-R fuzzy
numbers r, , , k = {ki}D
i=1,  = {i}D
i=1. We denote their
defuzzied versions, obtained by a maximum method (e.g.,
}D

form of a fuzzy random variable. We additionally assume that

membership functions are equal to 0 for all nonpositive argu-
ments.

The following theorem describes the analytical forms of -level

one can obtain the values of the membership functions  C V

and  P V
P V can be also comfortable tools for decision making. For a
sufciently high value of  (e.g.,  = 0.99) they can be treated
as the intervals of the arbitrage-free European call or put option
prices. Then any value from these intervals can be treated as
the arbitrage-free option price with a high enough membership
degree. For instance, if the current market price of the European
option is outside of the intervals, an appropriate course of action
(e.g., buying or selling the considered option) may be taken by
a nancial analyst.

Equality (47) implies (41) and (42). Finally, applying (45), (48),
(cid:2)
and (49)(52), we obtain (37) and (38).
It is worth to note that the application of fuzzy numbers in-
stead of intervals makes our approach more general and exible.
In the case when experts estimates of parameters have the form
of intervals, the option prices also have the interval forms. Their
analysis can be insufcient for the choice of an appropriate deci-
sion. In turn, in our approach the possibility of choice of -level
sets of the option prices for sufciently high   1 can enable to

choose such a decision and simplify the decision process. More-
over, the method of automatized decision-making proposed in
Section VI is intended and constructed for the fuzzy form of
option prices.

VI. AUTOMATIZED DECISION-MAKING

A. Computational Method

In this section we describe a method which was proposed in
[20], where the classical BlackScholes model was considered.
It was applied by us to the problem of catastrophe bond pricing
and presented in [41]. The mentioned method can be also used
for computation of values of the membership function  X t
for
Xt = Ct or Xt = Pt, where Ct and Pt are the option prices
described by Theorem 4, based on the forms of -level sets of
Xt. We will apply the equality (see, e.g., [20] for details)

 X t

(x) = sup
01

I( X t )



(x) .

 and h() = ( Xt)U

Theorem 4 implies that functions g, h : [0, 1]  R, where
g() = ( Xt)L
 , are continuous. It is easy
to verify that function g is increasing and function h is decreas-
ing. Furthermore, Xt is a normal fuzzy number. The value of
 X t

(x) is the solution of the optimization problem:
(OP1) max , subject to: g()  x  h(), 0    1,
which can be rewritten to the form:
(OP2) max , subject to: g()  x, h()  x, 0    1.
To obtain the solution of (OP2) it sufces to consider the

following three cases:

(x) = 1.
1) If x belongs to the interval [g(1), h(1)], then  X t
2) If the inequality x < g(1) is satised, then the following

problem should be solved:
(OP3) max , subject to: g()  x, 0    1.
(OP4) max , subject to: h()  x, 0    1.

3) If the inequality x > h(1) holds, then one should solve

The solutions of (OP3) and (OP4) can be obtained with ap-

plication of bisection search [20].

In our further considerations, we will use the following nota-

tions for a constant x:

 X t

(x) = sup
(x) = sup

#
#

(x) : x  x

B. Investment Decision Making

The fuzzy version of the European option pricing formula can
be applied to investment decision making. We present a modied
approach from [42], which was also applied in [41]. We use

410

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 2, APRIL 2017

formulas introduced and derived in [41], where the problem of
catastrophe bond pricing was considered.
We x t  [0, T ] and   [0, 1] (e.g.,  = 0.95). Similarly as
in the previous section, Xt = Ct or Xt = Pt, where Ct and Pt
are the option prices described by Theorem 4, corresponding to
crisp option prices Xt = Ct or Xt = Pt. Let Xt denotes the cur-
rent market price of the considered option. A nancial analyst
can consider the -level set of Xt as the interval of the option
prices. Any value from this set can be treated by a nancial ana-
lyst as the option price with an acceptable membership degree.
Besides the analysis of the -level set, the nancial analyst can
additionally consider the set V = {B, A, H, R, S} of possible
decisions, where:

1) B denotes a decision to buy (if the considered option is

signicantly undervalued);

2) A denotes a decision to accumulate (if the option is un-

dervalued);

3) H is a decision to hold (if X is fairly valued);
4) R is a decision to reduce (if the option is overvalued);
5) S denotes a decision to sell (if the option is signicantly
The advice choice function  : R2  2V is given by

overvalued).

The -level set ( Xt , Xt) can be used by the nancial analyst,
who can choose one of the decisions from this set. The choice of
an appropriate  can simplify the decision process. For a given
set of parameters and a current market price of the considered
option, the choice of a higher value of   1 can diminish
the number of elements of ( Xt , Xt) . Thus, the number of
appropriate decisions can be less than in the case of a smaller .

VII. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

The analytical formulas for -level sets of option prices
included in Theorem 4 enable us to calculate the prices di-
rectly without using any simulation or approximation methods.
We assume that the parameters mentioned at the beginning of
Section V are triangular fuzzy numbersfuzziness may reect
their big variabilities, difculties in estimation or incertitude of
nancial analysts in perception of the current market situation.
As a result, the option prices are given by the fuzzy numbers, as
well.

In this section, a thorough overview of pricing patterns is

performed.

A. Prices -Level Sets, Membership Function,
Sensitivity Analysis
Let us concentrate on the call option price with a strike price
K = 0.9 and time to maturity T  t = 1. In our valuations, we
assume the following set of fuzzy parameters and fuzzy assets
values (see Table I).

Now we can investigate the dependence of the -level sets
of the fuzzy call option price on the changing value of  (see
Fig. 1). The crisp value of this option is equal to 0.1354. Note,
that the wide 0-level set for the underlying instrument S may
represent its high variability which is often the case, for instance
on commodities markets [43].

The membership function  C t

Sensitivity analysis of 0.95-level sets of the fuzzy call option price to
changing triangular number of the parameter  (circles: right ends of the prices
0.95-level sets, triangles: left ends of the prices 0.95-level sets).

In Fig. 3, we may observe that when the left and right ends of
the 0.95-level set of the fuzzy parameter  are simultaneously
and gradually increased, 0.95-level sets of the fuzzy call option
price rise as well. This effect is consistent with the nonfuzzy
theory of pricing.

In a similar way, in Fig. 4, a sensitivity analysis of 0.95-level
sets of the fuzzy call option price with respect to the fuzzy
parameters k1 and k2, responsible for the sizes of positive and
negative jumps, is presented. It is evident that when the values
of the positive jump size grows, the call option price grows,
too. Analogously, when the values of the negative jump size

ability abruptly and noticeably increases.

gets smaller, the call option price decreases. This behavior is
concordant with the intuition and with the theoretical formulas
for the prices.

B. Pricing on a Volatile MarketCase Study

Having investigated the fuzzy option prices behavior, we may
now illustrate a typical market situation in which pricing in fuzzy
environment is especially advantageous. Consider a market with
an asset whose rolling volatility with a window length equal to
30 days is presented in Fig. 5. Assume that an investor wants to
price a call option based on the historical data. According to this
data, the historical volatility is equal to 0.0996 (it is estimated
as a mean of the presented rolling volatility). If he uses this
estimator and the model described in this paper, but with crisp
parameters equal to modal values of the parameters described
in Table I, then he obtains the crisp option price equal to 0.1374.
However, it is very likely that the quoted option price on the
market is higher, say 0.1424, as the assets volatility signi-
cantly increased. Then the implied volatility equals 0.13. If the
investor used an expert fuzzy number estimator for his models
volatility, e.g., (0.09, 0.0996, 0.16) (with the modal value equal
to the underestimated, historically based crisp estimator) and
chose  = 0.8, as a result he would obtain the price interval
(0.1305, 0.1426). The quoted option price 0.1424 lies within

this interval and thus we may conclude that even in case of
such unexpected market situation and highly variable assets
behavior, combined with the nonadequate historical volatility
estimator, the fuzzy approach does not exclude in its result the
actual option price. This example clearly points on benets from
using fuzzy approach.

C. Automatized Investment Decision Making

Finally, let us focus on automatized decision making, the
theory of which was described in Section VI. May the fuzzy
parameters remain unchanged (see Table I) and the triangle
number of the asset price S be (0.98, 1.015, 1.05). We also x 
at 0.95 level which means that an investor makes decisions from
the 0.95-level set ( Ct, Ct)0.95 depending on the current market
call option price Ct. The recommendations for ve different
market situations, with the fuzzy option price with modal value
equal to 0.1493, are summarized in Table II.

It is also interesting to analyze how the recommendation for a
particular decision changes when the market price of the call op-
tion evolves continuously. Such dependence is shown in Fig. 6.
Recommendation l (B) to buy the option decreases from 1 to 0
and achieves its minimum when the market price is equal to the
option crisp price. Recommendation l (R) to reduce is a mirror
imageit increases from 0 to 1, when the market price is below
the crisp price, and then remains at the maximal level.

VIII. APPLICATION OF THE METHOD

The method of option pricing and decision making in the
fuzzy environment proposed in this paper can be applied by
both the analyst and the investor. However, the cooperation of
the two can be helpful for the investor, since usually he does not
possess a detailed expert knowledge how the market perceives
the magnitudes of the parameters employed in the formulas for
the option price. The analyst can rely on his own experience,
additionally asking other experts for their recommendations. It
is widely known that the nancial market uctuates in time and
that statistical estimates of the parameters are imprecise and
biased. The possibility of taking into account the uncertainty of
the market in the form of fuzzy numbers ensures the appropri-
ate approach to options valuation and is a principal advantage
over existing in the literature methods. Thus, the application
of our method, which utilizes the experts opinions, broadens
the knowledge about the fair value of the nancial instrument.
A direct recipient of the method is the analyst, nevertheless an
indirect addressee is the investor. The analyst constructs the pa-
rameters in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers and selects an
adequately high value of . As a result, he receives the -level
set ( Ct , Ct) of possible investment decisions. Consulting
with the investor, together they appoint the nal decision.

Going to the pros and cons of the method, apart from the
aforementioned merits the approach has some disadvantage.
In comparison to the standard process of investment decision
making, it requires more intensive communication between the
investor and the analyst supported by a group of market experts.
It is due to the existence of more than one recommendations.
On the other hand, this methodology may lead to much more
balanced and cautious decisions. Performing reasonable analy-
sis, it enables us to make protable decisions which would not
be considered based on crisp pricing. To sum up, we reckon
that our approach brings decidedly more investment bonus than
troubles.

A. Financial Market Numerical Application

For the sake of illustration, we will present in details the
consecutive stages of the analysis conducted in Section VII-C.
Let us assume that the analyst together with two other experts
introduce their opinions in the form of the following triangular
fuzzy numbers:

for S : (0.65, 1, 1.1), (0.85, 0.88, 1.2), (0.9, 1.12, 1.3),
for  : (0.018, 0.033, 0.05), (0.021, 0.0305, 0.05), (0.021,
0.0265, 0.05),
for r : (0.032, 0.039, 0.07), (0.035, 0.041, 0.05), (0.023, 0.04,
0.06),
for  : (0.045, 0.11, 0.2), (0.058, 0.09, 0.15), (0.047, 0.1,
0.25),
for 1 : (0.042, 0.07, 0.11), (0.038, 0.08, 0.14), (0.04, 0.09,
0.11),
for 2 : (0.017, 0.065, 0.105), (0.019, 0.065, 0.109), (0.024,
0.065, 0.116),
for k1 : (0.01, 0.065, 0.101), (0.01, 0.076, 0.101), (0.01,
0.069, 0.098),

NOWAK AND PAWOWSKI: OPTION PRICING WITH APPLICATION OF LEVY PROCESSES AND THE MINIMAL VARIANCE

413

for k2 : (0.12, 0.06, 0.021), (0.13, 0.05, 0.016),
(0.14, 0.04, 0.023).
Computing averages of the above fuzzy numbers for every
parameter, the analyst obtains the fuzzy values of S, , r, , 1,
2, k1, k2, presented in Table I.



We assume that the analyst picked the 0.95 value of . Ac-
cording to the results shown in Table II, for different current
market values of the options, the sets of possible decisions have
the following forms:

The terminal decision is made by the investor on basis of the
obtained above -level sets.

Let us assume that the actual market price is equal to 0.145.
It refers to the third case of our example. As we can see, there
are three recommendations: A, H, R. Inasmuch as the actual
price is slightly less than the crisp price (equal to 0.1493), the
obvious, instantaneous recommendations would be to accumu-
late or to hold. Nevertheless, our method suggests taking into
consideration reducing the position in this derivative which on a
rst sight is unusual. However, this recommendation is strongly
justiable because the supports of fuzzy numbers of the volatil-
ity and the underlying asset price are wide and therefore it may
lead to a great change of the market option price and a reversion
of the relation between the actual market option price and the
crisp option price.

IX. CONCLUSION

In this paper we studied that the European option pricing
problem, assuming that the dynamics of the primary nancial
instrument is modeled by a geometric Levy process and the
jump part of the log-price, which describes positive and nega-
tive jumps in the asset prices, is a linear combination of Poisson
processes. We applied stochastic analysis to derive the crisp
European option valuation expressions, by using MVEMM as
the equivalent probability measure in the martingale method
of pricing. Applying fuzzy sets theory, we also obtained fuzzy
counterparts of the crisp pricing formulas, taking into account
the uncertainty of the models parameters. Furthermore, we pro-
posed an automatized method of decision making, based on the
fuzzy valuation expressions. Finally, we provided numerical
examples to illustrate our theoretical results.

Future possible direction of our studies is an extension of the
proposed approach to more complex underlying asset models.
Another interesting possibility is the derivation of the fuzzy val-
uation expressions for some classes of path-dependent options.
