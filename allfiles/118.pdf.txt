FN-TOPSIS: Fuzzy Networks for Ranking

Traded Equities

Abdul Malek Yaakob, Antoaneta Serguieva, Senior Member, IEEE, and Alexander Gegov, Member, IEEE

AbstractFuzzy systems consisting of networked rule bases,
called fuzzy networks, capture various types of imprecision inher-
ent in nancial data and in the decision-making processes on them.
This paper introduces a novel extension of the technique for order-
ing of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method
and uses fuzzy networks to solve multicriteria decision-making
problems where both benet and cost criteria are presented as
subsystems. Thus, the decision maker evaluates the performance
of each alternative for portfolio optimization and further observes
the performance for both benet and cost criteria. This approach
improves signicantly the transparency of the TOPSIS methods,
while ensuring high effectiveness in comparison with established
approaches. The proposed method is further tested to solve the
problem of selection/ranking of traded equity covering developed
and emergent nancial markets. The ranking produced by the
method is validated using Spearman rho rank correlation. Based
on the case study, the proposed method outperforms the existing
TOPSIS approaches in terms of ranking performance.

I. INTRODUCTION

M ULTICRITERIA decision-making (MCDM) problems

are often observed in reality, and decision makers (DMs)
are faced with the challenge of the presence of multiple criteria.
The focus is on identifying the best performing solution among
feasible alternatives assessed by a group of DMs and evaluated
through multiple criteria [1]. In portfolio optimization, investors
target high returns and affordable risks. Typically, assets with
the potential for high returns also carry a high market risk [2].
Structuring complex problems well and considering multiple
criteria explicitly lead to more informed and better decisions.
There have been important advances in the eld since the start
of the modern MCDM discipline in the early 1960s. Various
MCDM techniques have been developed with the overall ob-
jective to assist DMs solve complex decision problems in a
systematic, consistent, and more productive way.

TOPSIS is an MCDM technique for ranking and selection
of alternatives [15]. The TOPSIS analysis considers two ref-
erence pointsa positive ideal solution (PIS) and a negative
ideal solution (NIS)as well as the distances to both PIS and
NIS. The preference order is ranked according to the closeness
of PIS and NIS, and according to a combination of the two
distance measures. TOPSIS is considered as one of the major
decision-making techniques and, in recent years, has been ef-
fectively applied to the areas of human resource management
[3], transportation [4], product design [5], manufacturing [6],
water management [7], quality control [8], military [9], tourism
[10], food science [11], and location analysis [12].

TOPSIS is used in this research due to its stability and sim-
plicity of use with cardinal information [13]. TOPSIS has been
successfully applied in MCDM problems as one of the most
frequent methods used. The main advantage of the TOPSIS
methods is that they are easily implemented and understood, as
they directly dene values based on experts opinions in order
to calculate nal results [14].

Fuzzy TOPSIS was introduced to approach uncertainty in
linguistic judgment. Initial research on fuzzy TOPSIS was con-
ducted in [15], where TOPSIS is extended to type-1 fuzzy en-
vironments; this extended version used type-1 fuzzy linguistic
value (represented by type-1 fuzzy number [16]) as a substitute
for the directly given crisp value in grade assessment. Overall,
the type-1 fuzzy TOPSIS problem is to nd the most desirable
alternative(s) from a set of n feasible alternatives, according to
the decision information by DMs about attribute weights and
attribute values. There is no solution satisfying all attributes si-
multaneously, as attributes are conicting to some extent. Thus,
the solution is a set of noninferior solutions, or a compromise so-
lution according to the DMs preferences [17]. However, the ex-
isting fuzzy MCDM methods are only based on type-1 fuzzy sets
[18]. In order to offer better care for the problems of vagueness,
another discovery, type-2 fuzzy set was provided by Mendel,
John, and Liu [19]. This concept looks to comprehensively rep-
resent uncertainties, compared with type 1 fuzzy set, due to the
ability of providing more exible spaces [18].

Zadeh introduced the concept of type-2 fuzzy set [20], which
is a generalization of the concept of fuzzy set. This concept is
illustrated by a fuzzy membership function, where each element
of this set is a fuzzy set in [0, 1], unlike a type-1 fuzzy set where
the membership grade is a crisp number in [0, 1] [21]. The
membership functions of type 2 fuzzy set are 3-D and include
a footprint of uncertainty (FOU) as the new third dimension,
which can be described as the union of the primary member-

ships [22]. The FOU provides additional degrees of freedom to
directly model and process uncertainties, and type-2 fuzzy set
is more comprehensive compared with fuzzy set in providing
more exibility spaces to represent uncertainties [23]. The chal-
lenges in computational volume have led to the development of
interval type-2 fuzzy set in 2000 by Mendel and Liang [24]. It
can be viewed as a special case, as all values of secondary mem-
bership are equal to 1 [25]. Currently, interval type-2 fuzzy set is
widely used and successfully applied in perceptual computing
[26], [27], control systems [28][31], and the MCDM eld. One
of the MCDM methods incorporating interval type 2 fuzzy set
is the interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS (T2-TOPSIS), which was
rst established in [18]. The authors introduced a T2-TOPSIS
method to approach fuzzy MCDM problems.

Most recently, Z-number has been the newest fuzzy number
presented in the literature of fuzzy sets. Z-number is introduced
in [32] as an extension of type-1 fuzzy number but is completely
different from type-2 fuzzy number. Although both Z -number
and type-2 fuzzy number are extensions of type-1 fuzzy num-
ber, the former is capable of measuring the reliability of the
decision made while the latter is not. Since fuzzy numbers are
the medium of quantitative representation for natural language,
Z- number enhances the capability of both type-1 and type-2
fuzzy numbers by taking into account the reliability of the num-
bers used [32]. According to [33], Z-number is represented by
two embedded type-1 fuzzy numbers, where one of them plays
the role to dene the reliability of the rst one. Research on uti-
lizing Z-number in decision-making applications is inadequate
as compared with other fuzzy numbers, as it is a new concept de-
veloped in the theory of fuzzy sets. One of the MCDM methods
that implemented Z-number is called Z-TOPSIS and was rst
established in [34]. The authors presented a Z-TOPSIS method
to handle fuzzy MCDM problems, in order to give a mean-
ingful structure for formalizing information in decision-making
problems, as it takes into account DMs reliability. Z-number
uncertainty relates to fuzziness of class boundaries. Possibil-
ity theory is rooted in uncertainty of type-1; however, over the
years, possibility theory has moved in the direction of extending
its domain to accommodate uncertainty of type-2 [35].

Fuzzy systems are vital within the armory of fuzzy tools
and applicable to real-life decision-making environments. There
are three types of fuzzy systems introduced in the literature:
systems with a single rule base, systems with multiple rule
bases, and systems with networked rule bases. Systems with a
single rule base are characterized with a black box nature, where
the inputs are mapped directly to the output without considering
any internal connection. Systems with multiple rule bases are
characterized with a white box nature, where the inputs are
mapped to the outputs through interval variables as connections.
This type of systems is also termed chained fuzzy systems or
hierarchical fuzzy systems. The third type of fuzzy systems
incorporates networked rule bases and is termed fuzzy networks
(FN). FNs are introduced as a theoretical concept in [36] and
are characterized with a white box nature, where the inputs are
mapped to the outputs through intermediate variables.

According to [37], the accuracy of single rule base is moder-
ate, but the level of transparency is low, while multiple rule
bases are regarded as having low accuracy in dealing with

complex process management. While in most decision-making
studies, single rule bases and multiple rule bases are common
approaches [38], in this research, we focus on FNs as they are
both well transparent and accurate. A node represents each sub-
system in an FN, whereby the interactions among subsystems
are the connections between nodes. Therefore, FNs consider ex-
plicitly the interaction among subsystems [37]. An FN is more
transparent than a single-rule-based fuzzy system for decision
making because it considers separately benet-related and cost-
related criteria. This network takes into account explicitly the
internal structure of the modeled process by representing each
group of criteria as a node and the interactions among differ-
ent groups as connections. This network-based approach allows
the modeled process to be presented as a white box in contrast
with the existing system-based approaches that use a black-box
presentation. In this case, the white-box presentation improves
signicantly the transparency of the model due to the explicit
and adequate reection of the internal structure of the modeled
process. This ability brings considerable benets to modeling
complex processes, and although FNs have been introduced
recently, a signicant volume of work has been done and ded-
icated to the theoretical development and applications of FNs
[36], [37], [39], [40].

On the other hand, the reliability of decision information
and the experience of experts are still in need of better in-
corporation into modeling complex decision-making processes.
For example, how condent in their choices are investors as
DMs, and how much experience experts as nancial analysts
have in relevant asset classes and markets [41]. Furthermore,
existing TOPSIS methods have a very low transparency level
and, therefore, are not able to track the performance of ben-
et and cost criteria [42]. In decision-making processes, it is
important that DMs are aware of how the multiple criteria are
performing. Based on [43], in a decision-making environment,
it is essential to track the performance of criteria, in order to
take control and not underestimate or overestimate uncertainty
of the criteria. The proposed method represents a systematic
TOPSIS approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses
of alternatives that satisfy transactions, activities, or functional
requirements for a business. In addition to that, tracking of crite-
ria allows DMs to determine if it is a sound investment/decision
(justication/feasibility) and provides a basis for comparing al-
ternatives. In this case, it involves comparing the total expected
cost criteria of each alternative against the total expected benet
criteria, to see whether the benets outweigh the costs and by
how much. The inefciencies described above bring the moti-
vation of this study.

This paper proposes a novel FN-based modeling method that
represents an extension of fuzzy set theory. The method has
been validated comparatively against established fuzzy-system-
based modeling methods for a case study on ranking traded
equities. The main advantages of the proposed method in the
context of this case study are its higher transparency and ac-
curacy. This paper is structured as follows. Section II briey
reviews the concepts of fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, and the
operation of FNs. The novel methodology of TOPSIS using FNs
with merging rule base FN-TOPSIS is formulated in Section III.
Section IV illustrates the application of FN-TOPSIS to the

YAAKOB et al.: FN-TOPSIS: FUZZY NETWORKS FOR RANKING TRADED EQUITIES

problem of ranking equities traded on the major stock exchanges
in a developed and a developing nancial market. Further dis-
cussion and analysis of the FN-TOPSIS ranking performance
are provided in Section V. The main conclusions are summa-
rized in Section VI.

II. THEORETICAL PRELIMINARIES

A. Fuzzy Sets

Denition 1 (Type-1 fuzzy sets) [20]: A type-1 fuzzy set A

is dened on a universe X and is denoted as
A = {(x, A (x))|x  X}

where A (x) : X  [0, 1] is the membership function of A.
The membership A (x) describes the degree of belonging-
ness of x  X in A. Throughout this paper, type-1 and type-2
fuzzy numbers and Z-numbers are presented through trape-
zoidal membership functions. The good coverage of trapezoidal
membership functions is a good compromise between efciency
and effectiveness.

Denition 2 (Type-1 fuzzy numbers) [44]: A trapezoidal
type-1 fuzzy number is represented by the following member-
ship function:

A (x) = (a1, a2, a3, a4) =






x  a1
a2  a1
1,
a4  x
a4  a3
0,

,

,

if a1  x  a2
if a2  x  a3
if a3  x  a4

otherwise.

Denition 3 (Type-2 fuzzy sets) [19]: A type-2 fuzzy set A
in the universe of discourse X is represented by a type-2 mem-
bership function  A as follows:
A = {((x, u) ,  A
(x, u)  1}
where JX denotes an interval in [0, 1]. A type-2 fuzzy set A can
also be represented as

(x, u))|uJX  [0, 1] , 0 A

the interval type-2 fuzzy number A. In addition, j ( AU ) de-
notes the membership value of the element aU
(j+1) in the up-
per trapezoidal membership function AU for 1  j  2, and
j ( AL ) denotes the membership value of the lower trapezoidal
membership function AL for 1  j  2. Here, 1(AU )  [0, 1],
2(AU )  [0, 1], 1(AL )  [0, 1], and 2(AL )  [0, 1], for 1 
i  n.
Denition 5 (Z-numbers) [32]: Z-number is an ordered pair
of type-1 fuzzy numbers denoted as Z = ( A, B). The rst com-
ponent A, a restriction on the values, is a real-valued uncertain
variable. The second component B is a measure of reliability
for the rst component.
The concept of a Z-number Z = ( A, B) provides a basis for
computation with fuzzy numbers that have various reliabilities.
The second component B may be interpreted as a response to
the question: How condent are DMs that X is A.

B. Fuzzy Systems

A fuzzy system consists of a single rule base where inputs
are processed simultaneously without taking into account the
connections and the structure of the system. For this type of
system, the rules are derived based on expert knowledge about
the process. The results are normally quite accurate, but the poor
transparency of the system can be an obstacle to understanding
complex processes.

C. Fuzzy Networks

An FN is a new type of fuzzy system, which consists of net-
worked rule bases (nodes) and deals with inputs sequentially,
while taking into account the connections and structure of the
system. The rules for both fuzzy systems and FNs are derived
from knowledge and data. A networked fuzzy system is trans-
parent and fairly accurate at the same time due to its hybrid
nature, which facilitates the understanding and management of
complex processes.

There are four formal models for FNs characterized in [36],
namely: 1) IFTHEN rule and integer tables; 2) block schemes
and topological expressions; 3) incidence and adjacency ma-
trices; and 4) Boolean matrices and binary relations. Here, we

Rule 1 : If is S11 and  and pm is Sm 1, then q1 is T11and and ql is Tn1

Rule r : If is S1r and  and pm is Sm r , then q1 is T1r and and ql is Tn r .

employ IFTHEN rules and Boolean matrices, in order to repre-
sent the fuzzy rules. Hence, the properties of such models will
be reviewed briey. The choice is justied by the ability of these
formal models to work with any number of nodes in FNs.
A fuzzy system with r rules, m inputs p1, . . . , pm
taking linguistic terms from the sets {s11, . . . , s1r}, . . . ,
{sm 1, . . . , sm r}, and n outputs q1, . . . , qn taking linguistic
terms from the output sets {T11, . . . , T1r}, . . . ,{Tn1, . . . , Tn r},
can be described by the following rule base from (1), as shown
at the bottom of the previous page.

A rule base is incorporated as a node within the FN. A gen-
eralized Boolean matrix compresses information from a rule
base represented by a node. The row and column labels of the
Boolean matrix are all possible permutation of linguistics terms
of the inputs and outputs for this rule base. The elements of the
Boolean matrix are either 0s or 1s, where each 1 reects
a present rule. The Boolean matrix representation of the rule
base from (1) is given as

S11  Sm 1

S1r  Sm r

T11  Tn1  T1r  Tn r

Boolean matrices are very suitable for formal representation
of FNs [40]. They describe FNs at a lower level of abstrac-
tion with respect to individual nodes. Boolean matrices also
lend themselves easily to manipulation for the purpose of sim-
plifying FNs to linguistically equivalent fuzzy systems, using
the linguistics composition approach. In the next subsection,
we briey review two Boolean matrix operations, as these two
are involved in the FN-TOPSIS.

Basic operations: Horizontal merging is a binary operation
that can be applied to a pair of sequential nodes in FN. This
operation combines the operand nodes from the pair into a single
product node. The operation can be applied when the output
from the rst node is fed forward as an input to the second
node in the form of an intermediate variable. The product node
has the input from rst operand node and the output from the
second operand node, whereas the intermediate variable does
not appear in the product node.

Fig. 1. Horizontal merging of nodes.

Therefore, if the rst operand node is the rule base in (1)
that is represented by the Boolean matrix in (2), and the second
operand node is the rule base in (3), shown at the bottom of
the page, that is represented by the generalized Boolean matrix
in (4), see (3):

Then, the generalized Boolean matrix of (3) is described as

The product node is the rule base in (5), as shown at the
bottom of the page, and its generalized Boolean matrix of (5) is
constructed as

R11  Rg1  R1r  Rg r

.

.

(6)

The fuzzy system described by the rule base in (3) is
with r rules, n inputs q1, . . . , qn taking linguistic terms from
the input sets {T11, . . . , T1r}, . . . ,{Tn1, . . . , Tn r}, and g out-
puts w1, . . . , wg taking linguistic terms from the set of out-
puts {R11, . . . , R1r}, . . . ,{Rg1, . . . , Rg r}. Similarly, the fuzzy
system described by the rule base in (5) is with r rules,
m inputs p1, . . . , pm taking linguistic terms from the in-
put sets {S11, . . . , S1r}, . . . ,{Sm 1, . . . , Sm r}, and g outputs
w1, . . . , wg taking linguistic terms from the set of outputs
{R11, . . . , R1r}, . . . ,{Rg1, . . . , Rg r}. In general, the operand
rule bases may have a different number of rules, but the number
of rules in the product rule base is always equal to the number of
rules in the rst operand rule base. For simplicity, the notations
used in Fig. 1 are in a vector form where the vectors x, y, and v
are of dimensions n, m, and g, respectively.

Vertical merging is a binary operation that can be applied to
a pair of parallel nodes in an FN. The inputs to the product node
represent the union of the inputs to the operand nodes, and the
outputs from the product node represent the union of the output
from the operand nodes.

Therefore, if the rst operand node is the rule base in (1)
that is represented by the Boolean matrix in (2), and the second
operand is the rule base in (7), shown at the bottom of the page,
that is represented by the generalized Boolean matrix in (8):
then the generalized Boolean matrix of (8) is described with
(9):

The product node is the rule in the following equation:
Rule 1 : If p1 is S11 and  and pg is Sm 1 w1
is R11 and  and wg is Rg1 then q1 is and  and
qn is Tn1 and y1 is Q11 and  and yh is

Rule r  s :

In this case, the fuzzy system described by the rule base
in (8) has s rules, g inputs w1, . . . , wg taking linguistic terms
from the input sets {R11, . . . , R1s}, . . . ,{Rg1, . . . , Rg s}, and
h outputs y1, . . . , yh taking linguistic terms from the output sets
{Q11  Q1s}, . . . ,{Qh1  Qhs}. However, the fuzzy system
described by the rule base in (10) is with r  s rules, m + g
inputs x1, . . . , xm , w1, . . . , wg taking linguistic terms from the
input sets

{S11, . . . , S1r} , . . . ,{Sm 1, . . . , Sm r} ,

{T11, . . . , T1r} , . . . ,{Tn1, . . . , Tn r} ,
{Q11, . . . , Q1s} , . . . ,{Qh1, . . . , Qhs} .

The number of rules in the product rule base is equal to the
product of the number of rules in the operand rule bases. For
simplicity, the notations used in Fig. 2 are in a vector form, where
the vectors x, y, v, and w have dimensions n, m, g, and h, re-
spectively.

III. METHOD FORMULATION

In this approach, the DMs opinions are evaluated indepen-
dently, since they may have different inuence degrees, de-
pending on their experience in the area. Furthermore, criteria
are categorized into benet criteria or cost criteria. Each cat-
egory generates correspondingly benet fuzzy systems or cost
fuzzy systems, where the output of the systems is benet levels
(BLs) or cost levels (CLs), representing the performance of each
category. Fig. 3 illustrates the proposed generalized FN model

Rule s : If w1 is R1s and  and wg is Rg s , then y1 is Q1s and  and wg is Qhs

for TOPSIS, where benet system (BS), cost system (CS) and
alternative systems (AS) are incorporated in the form of FN
nodes. The inputs are the benet criteria B1, . . . , Be and the
cost criteria C1, . . . , Cf . At the end of the process, alternatives
levels (AL) are determined. The dotted frame represents the ver-
tical merging of rule bases, and the dashed frame illustrates the
horizontal merging of rule bases.

The next subsections illustrate systematically the implemen-
tation of type-1, type-2, and Z-fuzzy numbers to FN-TOPSIS.

A. Type-1 Fuzzy Number Implementation

Tables I and II are used by DMs to evaluate the rating of
alternatives and the importance of criteria, and Table III is used
to determine the AL as the output, in generating fuzzy rule
bases.

The following are the procedures involved in implementing
an FN with merging rule bases to TOPSIS, based on type-1fuzzy
numbers. Steps 16 are adopted from [15] and [45], while steps
710 are introduced as part of the proposed method in this paper.
Step 1: Construct decision matrices where each DM opinion
is evaluated independently, and categorize into two criteria cat-
egories as benet criteria and cost criteria dened through a BS
and a CS.

where xij,k are type-1 fuzzy sets representing the rating of al-
ternatives Aj (j = 1, . . . , m) with respect to benet criteria
Bi (i = 1, . . . , e) according to the kth DM, and gi,k are type-
1 fuzzy sets representing the weights of benet criteria Bi,k
(i = 1, . . . , e) according to the kth DM, where k = 1, . . . , K.
In addition, yij,k are type-1 fuzzy sets describing the rating
of alternatives Aj (j = 1, . . . , m) with respect to cost crite-
ria Ci (i = 1, . . . , f) according to the kth DM, and hi,k are
type-1 fuzzy sets describing the weights of cost criteria Ci
(i = 1, . . . , f) according to the kth DM, where k = 1, . . . , K.
Step 2: Construct weighted and normalized decision

matrices.

The fuzzy rating and weight of each criterion are variables
described with type-1 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The ratings
of alternatives Aj (j = 1, . . . , m) are described with the type-1
trapezoidal fuzzy numbers xij,k = (ax
) and

yij,k = (ay

are, respectively, represented by gi,k = (ag

CLm is m ,k

(26)
where CL is the cost level of alternatives, for j = 1, . . . , m and
k = 1, . . . , K.

Step 7: Construct the antecedent matrices and consequent

matrices for the AS.

The AS antecedent matrices Mk are based on the BLs k and
CLs k , which are the outputs of the BS and CS correspond-
ingly. The antecedent matrix of a system with two inputs, i.e.,
BL and CL, each taking m possible values, will be usually of
size 2  (m  m), as presented in the following:

Mk =

BL
CL

(cid:24)

1,k  1,k  m ,k  m ,k
1,k  m ,k  1,k  m ,k

(cid:25)

,

for k = 1, . . . , K.

(27)
However, in this case, each tuple of inputs (j,k , j,k ) stands
for the assessed levels of the same alternative j through two types
of criteriabenets and costs. Therefore, the AS antecedent

YAAKOB et al.: FN-TOPSIS: FUZZY NETWORKS FOR RANKING TRADED EQUITIES

matrices Mk are of size 2  m, as constructed in the following:

Mk =

1,k 2,k 3,k  m ,k
1,k 2,k 3,k  m ,k

(cid:25)

for k = 1, . . . , K.

,

(28)

The AS consequent matrices are derived as follows:
i) Calculate the aggregation j,k of weighted N ICC B

j,k and
N ICC C
j,k ; the division by two in (29) reects the equal impor-
tance of each of the two subsystems by means of a weighted
mean:

,

(29)
ii) Normalize the values of j,k to ensure they lie within [0, 1],

as calculated in the following:

j,k

,

N j,k =

maxj j,k

for j = 1, . . . , m and k = 1, . . . , K.
(30)
iii) For N j,k , take linguistic terms from Table III for the
ALs. The translation of scalars to linguistic terms is done in the
same way as in (22). Then, the K for AS consequent matrices,
in this case of size 1  m rather than 1  m  m, are described
as
Nk = AL

for k = 1, . . . , K

N 1,k N 2,k  N m ,k
where AL is the level of alternatives.

(31)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

,

Therefore, the AS is presented with K matrix decision rules,

as constructed in the following:

(cid:27)

(cid:26)

BL
CL
(cid:28)

1 , k 1 , k  m , k
1 , k 2 , k  m , k
N 1 , k N 2 , k  N m , k

if Mk =

Nk = AL

, then

(cid:29)

,

for k = 1, . . . , K (32)

and can be described with the rule bases as

Rule 1 : If BL is 1,k and CL is 1,k , then AL is N 1,k

...

...

...

Rule m : If BL is m ,k and CL is m ,k then AL
is N m ,k ,

(33)
where BL is the level of benets, CL is the level of costs, and
AL is the level of alternatives.

for k = 1, . . . , K

Step 8: Construct the generalized Boolean matrix represent-

ing the overall system.

Having derived the rules for the three systemsBS, CS, and
ASwe can now translate these rules into Boolean matrix form.
The generalized BS Boolean matrix for each alternative j is
constructed in (34), based on the opinions of all K DMs:

x1j,1  xej,1

j,1  j,K
1 
0
...
...
...
x1j,K  xej,K 0 
1

...

,

for j = 1, . . . , m (34)

where the row and column labels of the Boolean matrix are all
possible permutation for the BS rule base of the linguistics terms
for the input 17 as in Tables I and II, and of the linguistic terms
for the output 15 as in Table III.

The generalized CS Boolean matrix for each alternative j is

constructed in (35) based on the opinions of all K DMs:

y1j,1  yf j,1

j,1  j,K
1 
0
...
...
...
y1j,K  yf j,K 0 
1

...

,

for j = 1, . . . , m (35)

where the row and column labels of the Boolean matrix are all
possible permutation for the CS rule base of the linguistics terms
for the input 17 as in Tables I and II, and of the linguistic terms
for the output 15 as in Table III.

The vertical merging of the BS and CS generalized Boolean
matrices will produce the generalized Boolean matrix con-
structed as

,

for j = 1, . . . , m.

(36)

x1j,K  xej,K
y1j,K  yf j,K
Next, the AS generalized Boolean matrix for each alternative

j is introduced in (37) based on the opinions of all K DMs:

x1j,1  xej,1
y1j,1  yf j,1

...

j,1
j,1

j,1 j,1

...

j,K j,K

,

for j = 1, . . . , m.

(37)

Then, the resultant generalized Boolean matrix for the overall
system for each alternative j is produced in (38) based on the
opinions of all K DMs:

(38)
Step 9: Derive the rules for the alternatives based on the
generalized Boolean matrix from (40), as shown below for j =
1, . . . , m :

Rule 1 : If B1 is x1 j,1 and  and Be is xe j,1 and C1 is y1 j,1
and  and Cf is yf j,1 , then AL is N j,1

: If B1 is x1 j, K and  and Be is xe j, K and C1 is y1 j, K

Step 10: Derive a nal score for each alternative.
In order to produce a nal score j for each alternative j,
take the average aggregate membership value of the consequent
part of the nj rules in (38). Then, multiply with the inuence
multiplier based on the K DMs average inuence degree for
alternative j. This is shown as

Thus, the ranking order of all alternatives can be determined:
the better alternatives j have higher values of j . The alter-
natives we have developed the above ranking approach for are
stock exchange traded equities. We have considered application
to a developing nancial market and are currently extending the
application to comparison of performance in developing and
developed nancial markets.

B. Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Number Implementation

In this implementation of FN-TOPSIS, we use interval type-2
fuzzy number, as detailed in Tables IVVI, for rating of alter-
natives and weighting the importance of criteria. All linguistics
terms are written in the form of trapezoidal type-2-fuzzy num-
bers.

In terms of steps involved in the implementation of type-2
fuzzy numbers in FN-TOPSIS, the concept of ranking trape-
zoidal interval type-2 fuzzy numbers is relevant to step 3 prior
to nding the distance of alternatives from PISs and NISs. The
other steps are the same as type-1 fuzzy sets implementation
discussed in Section III-A:

Step 3: Find the FPIS and FNIS for each alternative, and the

distance between each alternative to FPIS and FNIS.

In order to construct the ranking weighted decision matrices,
for j = 1, . . . , m and k = 1, . . . , m, we need to calculate the
ranking value of each interval type-2 fuzzy numbers vij,k , i.e.,
Rank(vij,k ).The maximum number n of edges in the upper
membership function vU
ij,k and the lower membership function
ij,k are rst dened, where i = 1, . . . , e + f and j = 1, . . . , m.
vL
If n is an odd number and n  3, then r = n + 1. If n is an even
number and n  4, then r = n. The Rank(vij,k ) of an interval

type-2 fuzzy numbers is presented as

C. Z-Number Implementation

For the Z-number implementation of TOPSIS-FN, Tables I
III from Section III-A are used, with an additional Table VII
for the linguistic terms representing DM reliability.

Here, the reliability of experts is taken into consideration
during the decision-making process. The experts are advised to
use the linguistic terms in Table VII to evaluate the condence
in their decision. DMs are not supposed to use negative weight
to represent their opinion. Otherwise, this would imply the use
of unreliable information, which is undesirable. This applies at
the start of step 1 of the algorithm described in type-1 fuzzy
number implementation of FN-TOPSIS. The other steps are the
same as the implementation discussed in Section III-A.

Step 1: Use the information from Table VII to derive the
second component B of the Z-number, and then, convert the
Z-number to type-1 fuzzy number.
)|x 
Let Z = ( A, B) is a Z-number, where { A = (x,  A
[0, 1]},{ B = (x,  B
)|x  [0, 1]}, and  A and  B are trape-
zoidal membership functions. The second part (reliability) needs

325

(44)

to convert into a crisp number using fuzzy expectation, as

(cid:7)

(cid:7)

 =

x B dx
 B dx

(cid:7)

where
denotes an algebraic integration. Then, add the weight
of the second part (reliability) to the rst part (restriction).
Weighted Z-numbers can be denoted as
Z  = {(x,  A  )| A  (x) =  A

(x) , x  [0, 1]} .
These can be represented with type-1 fuzzy numbers as
, x  [0, 1]
(cid:9) =

< x,  Z  (x) > | Z  (x) =  A

(

.

Z



x


 

!

(cid:9)

It is proven in [33] that Z

has the same fuzzy expectation
as Z  . The remaining steps of the algorithm are the same as
for the type-1 fuzzy sets implementation. The next section sys-
tematically illustrates the application of type-1 fuzzy sets of the
proposed FN-TOPSIS method to solve the problem of selec-
tion/ranking of traded equity.

IV. RANKING OF TRADED EQUITY

We study the problem of ranking traded equity in developing
nancial markets within a crisis period, in order to illustrate the
applicability and validity of the proposed FN methodology in a
realistic scenario. DMs with different levels of experience eval-
uate 25 equities listed on the main board of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange (KLSE) on November 30, 2007. A set of -
nancial ratios for the equities are considered toward the benet
and cost criteria in the FN-TOPSIS algorithm. These include the
following: 1) Market value of rm (B1), dened as market value
of rm-to-earnings before amortization, interest, and taxes. This
is one of the critical nancial indicators, and the lower the ra-
tio, the better the equity [46]. 2) Return on equity (ROE) (B2),
which evaluates how much the company earns on the investment
of its shareholders. ROE is measured as net income divided by
stockholder funds. Portfolio managers examine ROE when de-
ciding whether to trade (buy or sell) equities. The higher values
of the ratio indicate healthier companies. 3) Debt-to-equity ratio
(C1), belonging to long-term solvency ratios that are intended
to address the rms long run ability to meet its obligations. It
is considered by DMs that the lower the ratio, the better [47].
4) Current ratio (B3), which measures liquidity of companies
and explains the ability of a business to meet its current obli-
gations when fall due. The higher the ratio, the more liquid is
the company and, therefore, in a better position.[48]. 5) Market
value-to-net sales (B4) is market value ratios of particular inter-
est to investors. The lower the ratio, the better the equity [49].
The lower this ratio is, the better the equity. 6) Price/earnings
ratio (C2) measures the ratio of market price of each share of
common stock to the earnings per share, the lower this ratio, the
better.

In this study, the processes of ranking equities follow the pro-
posed methods in Section III. Fig. 4 illustrates the FN model for
the problem of selection/ranking of traded equity and includes
four benet criteria and two cost criteria.

FN for the FN-TOPSIS application to ranking traded equity.

Step 1: Based on the information provided by experts and
using (11), the decision matrices for the BS and CS can be
constructed. The rating of each criterion for each equity and the
importance of criteria are based on DMs opinions.

Step 2: Considering the BS, the normalized decision matrix
k and the weight normalized decision matrix V B
k can be con-

RB
structed for each k, using (12) correspondingly.

For example, the calculations for E1 using the opinion of

DM1 are as follows:

1 ,1 = 10

g1 ,1 = (0.9, 1, 1, 1) ; x11 ,1 = (9, 10, 10, 10) ; dx
11 ,1 = (9/ 10, 10/ 10, 10/ 10, 10/ 10) = (0.9, 1, 1, 1)
rB
11 ,1 = (0.9  0.9, 1  1, 1  1, 1  1) = (0.81, 1, 1, 1) .
vB
This step is then repeated for the CS, in order to calculate
k and the weight normalized

the normalized decision matrix RC
decision matrix V C
k .

Step 3: The FPIS and the FNIS for each equity based on both
systems, and the distances between the rating of criteria for each
equity and the FPIS and FNIS, can be evaluated as follows.

FPIS and FNIS are determined as

For example, using (21), and according to the rst DM k = 1,

j,k and ICC C

Step 5: The ICCs ICC B

j,k for each DM k are
derived by applying the inuence degree k of each DM, using
(18) and (19). Then, the normalized coefcients N ICC B
j,k and
N ICC C

j,k are calculated with (20).

For example, the inuence degree of DM1 is 1 = 8, and

using (18), his normalized expertise is

1 =

(cid:21)3

l=1 l

=

8 + 10 + 7

= 0.32.

Then, the ICC ICC B1,1 for the BS for equity E1 according to

DM1 is calculated with (19) as

ICC B

1,1 = 1  CC B

1,1 = 0.32  0.751 = 0.2403.

Similarly, the corresponding ICC for the CS ICC C1,1 is produced
as

ICC C

1,1 = 1  CC C

1,1 = 0.32  0.457 = 0.1462.

Next, the ICCs have to be normalized prior to matching the
coefcients to the linguistic variable in Table III. Using (20),
N ICC B1,1 and N ICC C1,1 are calculated as

By analogy, the rule base for the CS is constructed.
Step 7: The AS in this application is the equity system (ES),
and the antecedent matrices Mk of each DM k for ES are con-
structed using (28) based on the BL and CL, which are the
outputs of the BS and CS, respectively. Each DM has a separate
equity antecedent matrix Mk . Next, the ES consequent matrices
Nk are derived using (29)(31), while calculating the aggre-
gations j,k of weighted coefcients N ICC B
j,k and N ICC C
j,k
for each equity j (j = 1, . . . , 25), then producing the normal-
ized aggregations N j,k , and constructing the ES consequent
matrices Nk based on N j,k . Each DM k has a separate equity
consequent matrix Nk .

For example, based on the BL and CL evaluated in step 6
above and using (27), the ES antecedent matrix M1 according
to DM1 is evaluated as

.

Next, the ES consequent matrix N1 according to DM1 is

derived through:

i) calculating the aggregated closeness coefcient j,1 for each
equity j = 1, . . . , 25, with (28) and based on the normalized

closeness coefcients N ICC B
DM1, e.g., for j = 1:

ii) calculating the normalized aggregated closeness coefcients
N j,1 for each equity j = 1, . . . , 25 with (29) and based on
the values j,1 produced in Step 7(i) above, e.g., for j = 1:

N 1,1 =

1,1

maxj j,1

=

0.48
0.50

= 0.96

and the value of N 1,1 is matched to the linguistic variable for
equity levels in Table III:

N 1,1 = 0.960 = V G

iii) the ES consequent matrix N1 for DM1 is constructed using
(30) and based on the values N j,1 for each equity j produced
in Step 7(ii) above, e.g., for j = 1:

E1

E2

(cid:16)

N1 = EL

(cid:17)

Therefore, the ES rule base according to DM1 is evaluated

using (25) and (26) as

(cid:17)

If BL is VG and CL is VG, then EL is VG
If BL is VG and CL is VG, then EL is VG

Rule 1 :
Rule 2 :

Rule 25 : If BL is G and CL is G, then EL is G.

Step 8: Having list of rules for three systemsBS, CS, ES
we now present these rules in the Boolean matrix form. The
Boolean matrices for each equity are constructed based on the
opinions from all DMs. For example, using (33), the Boolean
matrix of the BS for E1 is produced in (45).The row and column
labels of the Boolean matrix are all possible permutations of
linguistics variable for the input 17 as in Table I and the lin-
guistic variable for the output 15 as in Table III, for the benet

performed to merge the Boolean matrix obtain from the ver-
tical merging operation with the ES Boolean matrix for each
equity. For example, applying vertical merging of the BS and
CS Boolean matrices for E1, the resultant Boolean matrix is
constructed as

From the Boolean matrix in (49), the rule basis for equity E1

is derived as

Rule 2 : 6576/64/5
Rule 3 : 7655/44/5

The rules in (50) with six inputs and one output can be repre-

sented in linguistic terms as

Rule 1 : If B1 is G, and B2 is MG and B3 is VG and B4
is G and C1 is F and C 2 is F, then E1 is VG
Rule 2 : If B1 is G, and B2 is M G and B3 is V G
and B4 is G and C1 is G and C2 is F , then E1 is V G
Rule 3 : If B1 is V G , and B2 is G and B3 is M G and
B4 is M G and C1 is F and C2 is F , then E1 is V G
Rule 4 : If B1 is V G, and B2 is G and B3 is M G and
B4 is M G and C1 is G and C2 is F , then E1 is V G

Rule 5 : If B1 is V G, and B2 is V G and B3 is V G
and B4 is G and C1 is F and C2 is F , then E1 is V G
Rule 6 : If B1 is V G, and B2 is V G and B3 is V Gand
B4 is G and C1 is G and C2 is F , then E1 is V G. (51)
Step 10: The nal score for each alternative j = 1, . . . , 25 is
derived with (39), by taking average of the aggregate member-
ship value of the consequent part of all active rules in the overall
system for equity j and then multiplying with the inuence mul-
tiplier based on the average inuence degree across all K DMs
for each equity j.

For example, there are six active rules for E1 generated from
the Boolean matrix operation. Equation (39) is used in order
to obtain nal score for E1; the average aggregate membership
value for the output of the six rules is calculated and, then,
multiplied with the inuence multiplier for E1 across all DMs

sidered in this case study, and based on type-1, type 2, and
Z fuzzy number implementation of the proposed FN-TOPSIS
method, are provided in Table VIII.

V. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

For the validation of the proposed rule-based FN-TOPSIS, the
authors consider established TOPSIS methods, as the nonfuzzy
TOPSIS [13] and the nonrule-based fuzzy TOPSIS approaches:
T1-TOPSIS [15], T2-TOPSIS [18], and Z-TOPSIS [34]. All
these methods are applied to evaluate the nal ranking of the
equities as shown in Table IX, based on case study in Section IV
and compared with the performance of FN-TOPSIS. The actual
monthly equity returns in November 2007, based on trading
the shares of the 25 companies on the KLSE and holding for a
month, are used for benchmarking. The rankings are compared
using the Spearman rho correlation coefcient , where  mea-
sures the strength of association between two ranked variables.
This comparison approach is intuitively interpretable and less
sensitive to bias due to the effect of outliers [50]. The Spear-
mans Rank coefcient is evaluated as
 = 1  6 (cid:21)
2
n3  n

(52)

i

where i represents the difference between the ranks, and n is
the number of considered alternatives.

The coefcient  takes values between +1 and 1. Perfect
positive relationship of ranks is indicated with  = 1, and  =
1 indicates perfect negative association of ranks, while  = 0
shows no relationship.

Considering the criteria set used, i.e., B1, B2, B3, B4, C1,
and C2 of traded equity described in Section IV, the three
proposed FN TOPSIS methods (PM) outperform the four es-
tablished TOPSIS methods (EM), as shown in the last row
of Table X.

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper

introduces a novel TOPSIS methodFN-
TOPSISextending the capabilities of rule-based FNs within
MCDM analysis. FN-TOPSIS uses type-1, type-2, and Z-fuzzy
numbers and incorporates experts knowledge into decision
analysis as well as experts degree of experience and inu-
ence. At the same time, the approach improves transparency
of decision analysis, particularly, in the TOPSIS process, by
explicitly taking into account all subsystems and interactions
among them. FN-TOPSIS not only provides an effective way to

process imperfect information in decision-making practice in a
more exible and intelligent manner, but also presents expert
knowledge more accurately. The performance of the proposed
method is validated using a benchmark and comparing against
a set of competitive approaches. The results show that the pro-
posed method outperforms the existing nonrule-based TOPSIS
methods in terms of ranking performance. We have successfully
applied FN-TOPSIS to the problem of ranking equities traded in
a developing nancial market during a crisis period. This study
continues research on hybrid approaches, implementing fuzzy
set theory in equity ranking and investment decisions, in a de-
veloped market (U.K.) during a precrisis period [51][54]. The
next objective is to implement and analyze the performance of
the approach within developing and developed nancial markets
during a postcrisis period.
