Feedback Controllers as Financial Advisors for Low-Income Individuals

Hugo Gonzalez Villasanti and Kevin M. Passino, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract— Feedback controllers are introduced to help manage
an individual’s or household’s ﬁnancial life and build savings. The
controllers can be viewed as ﬁnancial advisors for an individual’s
resource allocation problem, which is modeled as a nonlinear
discrete time stochastic system with income uncertainties, asset
losses, and constraints on cash ﬂow and credit. We introduce a
model predictive controller (MPC) and a proportional-integral-
derivative (PID) controller, and compare them with a benchmark
method employed in ﬁnance and economics, stochastic dynamic
programming (DP). Both MPC and PID produce similar consis-
tency in ﬁnancial management compared with DP. They also
offer the advantage of low computational complexity relative
to DP, which allows us to efﬁciently perform assessments of
robustness (reliability) and disturbance rejection (e.g., effects of
uncertainties), both of which are of signiﬁcant practical engineer-
ing importance. In addition, this ﬂexibility enables us to uncover
the system’s properties, such as the existence of a “poverty
trap" caused by constraints in the control space and dynamics.
The effectiveness of a PID-based aid intervention for low-skilled
and low-endowed agents that lie within the trap is assessed
and contrasted with other existing cash transfer programs, with
results that support a further implementation analysis. These
assessments constitute a novel application of feedback controllers
that, besides effectively dealing with scarcity constraints, present
practical advantages that are shown to translate into an ability
to implement the MPC or PID controller in a variety of ways
for low-income individuals via computer-assistive methods (e.g.,
a cell phone).

I. INTRODUCTION

H UMANITY is facing signiﬁcant challenges to improve

the quality of life of more than 1 billion people that
live in extreme poverty. Engineers are increasingly committing
themselves to developing and implementing technologies that
improve the overall welfare of the poor [1], proposing practical
applications based on the empirical and theoretical ﬁndings in
the context of social, political, and economical systems. This
brief introduces the use of “feedback control engineering” to
help poor manage their ﬁnancial lives.

This brief aimed at alleviating poverty has identiﬁed best
practices to overcome poverty, as noted in [2] and [3].
The optimal allocation of investment and consumption has
been studied in [4], with extensions to household ﬁnance

in [5], and some insights into households in developing
economies can be found in [6]. Viewing economic systems
as evolving dynamical systems, where agents need to adapt
themselves to a changing environment, can lead to a holistic
view of the phenomena and the design of better tools to help
with the pressing need for managing the economic lives of the
poor.

Various publications stress the importance of providing
better tools for the ﬁnancial lives of the poor [2], [7]–[9].
In [7], three fundamental ﬁnancial needs are identiﬁed from a
survey of 250 households from South Asia and South Africa.
The ﬁrst of these needs is to cope with irregular income to
meet daily basic needs. The second is to deal with “shocks,”
even with low savings, and the third is to ﬁnd strategies
to accumulate larger sums of money via savings. This last
need is considered as signiﬁcant importance in [2], where,
after analyzing individuals in 49 villages in Thailand, the
authors concluded that the households that could accumulate
savings by any means often dealt better with uncertainties and
shocks.

Treating an economic agent and the local market as a
dynamical system opens the possibility of employing feedback
controllers both in economics [10]–[12] and ﬁnance [13], [14].
Furthermore, controllers to manage budgets, overcome sav-
ings, and credit constraints could become tools to overcome
low ﬁnancial literacy of people in poverty [15], and achieve
resilience by adapting to the changing environment when
dealing with risk and uncertainties. A potential framework
for the implementation of these controllers could be a micro-
ﬁnance institution that deals with individuals (households),
and mainly small-scale entrepreneurs, seeking to improve
their well-being and escape poverty. There has been a broad
consensus among scholars on the role of microﬁnance as a
tool to alleviate poverty [7], [8], and their close contact with
people represents an attractive alternative to apply feedback
controllers as ﬁnancial advisors for their clients.

Building on this brief, our goal is to model the ﬁnancial life
of low-income individuals and ﬁnd, via feedback controllers,
the decisions he/she must make in order to cope with the
three needs stated above. Also, the external interventions in
the form of cash transfers that must be performed in order to
assist them in this ﬁnancial quest are assessed, including a
PID-based transfer program. Overall, this brief provides a
novel and important application of feedback controllers, one
that directly assists individuals in escaping poverty with
mobile or PC implementation.

models of ﬁnancial resource allocation between risky and
risk-less assets of Merton [4] and Samuelson [17], and their
subsequent improvements that introduced various constraints,
we propose a discrete time multiple input multiple output
stochastic model with state-dependent constraints that reﬂect
income uncertainties, investments, risks, liquidity, and credit
constraints for underprivileged households. The dynamical
model presented here intends to reﬂect the three main chal-
lenges identiﬁed in [7], along with ﬁnancial management data
of poor families in [2].

A. Household Dynamics

In ﬁnancial accounting, individual wealth is usually repre-
sented as composed of two dimensions: assets and liabilities.
Meanwhile, assets are classiﬁed either in current and ﬁxed
assets. In this brief, we model current assets as composed
only of cash in hand x1(k) ∈ R while ﬁxed assets are
modeled as x2(k) ∈ R. We assume that all the agent’s ﬁxed
assets generate income, thus referring to x2(k) as capital.
We also consider that the current assets are employed to fund
consumption and all transactions that require cash, and that
the sale of ﬁxed assets is done without cost or time delay.
is represented with x3(k) ∈ R. Thus,
Liabilities or debt
the state variable is x(k) = [x1(k), x2(k), x3(k)]T and the
control or decision variable is u(k) = [u1(k), u2(k), u3(k)]T ,
where u1(k) ∈ R is the agent’s expenses or consumption, and
u2(k) ∈ R is the ﬂow from capital to cash in hand in period
k to fund consumption u1(k) and debt payment u3(k) ∈ R,
which is positive (negative), when it decreases (increases)
debt. Here, we will represent an agent who, at each time
step, must decide how much to consume for a household’s
needs, how much to invest into the working capital x2(k) to
secure future income, how much to decrease or increase debt
x3(k), and how much to save, i.e., increase cash in hand x1 in
order to overcome uncertain income and possible shocks. The
model is

⎛
⎝x1(k) − 3(cid:4)
j=1

⎞
⎠ (1 − s1(k))
x1(k + 1) =
x2(k + 1) = (x2(k) + u2(k))(1 + i2(k) − s2(k))
x3(k + 1) = (x3(k) − u3(k))(1 + i3)

(1b)
(1c)
where i2(k) ∈ R is a random return on the capital invested
x2(k). As the markets in developing countries evolve in a
different way than in the developed world and there is a gap
in the literature in representing those markets, we chose to
model this variable as i2(k) = μ + σ (k), where μm is the
expected or mean return on the investment and σ (k) is a
zero mean Gaussian random variable. Furthermore, i3 ≥ 0
is the debt interest rate, and the random variables s1(k) ≥ 0
and s2(k) ≥ 0 represent negative shocks to cash in hand and
working capital, respectively, e.g., unexpected healthcare cost
or damage to assets by natural disasters. They are modeled as
independent and uncorrelated discrete time events with speciﬁc
probability mass functions deﬁned below.

u j (k)

(1a)

B. Constraints

The constraints on the control space can be modeled as

u1(k) ≥ cmin ≥ 0
u2(k) ≥ −x2(k)
u3(k) ≥ x3(k) − clim
u1(k) + u2(k) + u3(k) ≤ x1(k)

(2a)
(2b)
(2c)
(2d)

where the lower bound on u1(k) is the subsistence constraint or
minimum consumption needed to survive. The lower bound on
u2(k) is the available amount for disinvestment and the lower
bound corresponding to u3(k) is determined by the available
amount to withdraw as credit, which is the difference between
the amount owed and the credit limit clim ≥ 0. Next, the
upper bound on the sum u1(k)+ u2(k)+ u3(k) is the liquidity
constraint, and it simply implies that at the beginning of each
period k, the agent cannot create a budget that will deplete
all of his cash in hand, and if the desired consumption u1(k)
is greater than the available cash, i.e., if u1(k) > x1(k), then
the deﬁcit must be covered by the working capital x2(k) via
u2(k) < 0 and/or via debt with u3(k) < 0 as explained above.

C. Objective Function

∗ ∈ U

∗|+|u(k)−u

∗|T R|u(k)−u

∗|T Q|x(k)−x

With this model, we will try to develop controllers that
help the agent to build savings that will make him/her more
resilient to shocks and uncertainty. Our goal is not to model
the agent’s behavior by employing cost functions, such as the
constant relative risk aversion utility function or other standard
isoelastic cost function [18]; instead, we seek to minimize a
running quadratic cost over a ﬁnite horizon with target states
∗ ∈ R2 and controls u
x
g(x, u) = |x(k)−x

∗|.
(3)
The parameters of Q and R assign weights to consumption,
the desire to quickly accumulate assets, or the commitment to
pay debt. Although these values correspond to behavioral traits
and a connection that can be drawn with standard economic
terms, such as impatience and risk aversion, more research
is needed to properly establish this connection. Here, we
distance ourselves from the economic questions and instead
focus on performance and reliability assessment. Throughout
this brief, we make the assumption that the agents have perfect
knowledge of the states, i.e., the agent has information about
his/her cash in hand, working capital, and debt, which is
usually the case for individuals or households with a basic
level of ﬁnancial literacy. This avoids the need for estimators
and observers for the state.

III. HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC DECISION MAKING

USING FEEDBACK

A. Dynamic Programming

A very common method employed to solve dynamic
economic models, such as the one above,
is dynamic
programming (DP). Using the terminology found [19], the
basic problem in DP uses
x(k + 1) = fk (x(k), u(k), w(k)),

k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1

2196

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 25, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2017

where the state x(k) is an element of S(k) and control
u(k) ∈ Uk(x(k)). The random disturbance w(k) is assumed
to be independent of the past values of the disturbance. Using
the principle of optimality, an optimal control policy is found
employing the following routine, which proceeds backward in
time from period N − 1 to period 0 by

JN (x N ) = gN (x N )
{gk(x(k), u(k), w(k))
Jk(x(k)) = min
u(k)∈Uk
+ Jk+1( fk(x(k), u(k), w(k)))}

E
w(k)

(5)

for k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1

J0(x0) = J

∗(x0).

In general, a closed-form solution for the DP routine is
not possible except for some special cases. One typically has
to resort to a discretization of the state space and proceed
with a numerical computation. The computational effort that
increases with the number discretization points leads to the
“curse of dimensionality,” which implies that
the realistic
models with a large number of variables can quickly become
intractable in terms of computational analysis and implemen-
tation. Numerical methods to overcome the curse have been
proposed in [20] and [21], although the computational cost
still remains high for practical implementation, as seen in
this brief. Here, we considered the problem as an inﬁnite-
horizon stochastic shortest path problem and solve it via policy
iteration, employing a scattered data interpolation algorithm.

B. Model Predictive Control

Model predictive controller (MPC) features the explicit use
of a model to predict the economic system’s behavior, and the
calculation of a control sequence minimizing a cost function
with a receding horizon strategy. The process is repeated at
each time step with the use of the output measurements. The
MPC resembles human decision making with the use of a
model (mental model of the process) [22]. To present the
formulation, suppose we have
x (k + 1) = fk (x(k), u(k), w(k)),
with the same assumptions as DP with respect to x(k) ∈ Sk
and u(k) ∈ Uk(x(k)). Then, the MPC algorithm proceeds as
follows at each time k.
1) Given a time horizon k + m, ﬁnd a controller sequence

k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1

{u(k), u(k + 1), . . . , u(k + m − 1)} that minimizes

k+m−1(cid:4)
i=k

gi (x(i ), u(i ))

subject to the constraints

x(i + 1) = fi (x(i ), u(i ))

u(i ) ∈ Ui ,

i = k, k + 1, . . . , k + m − 1.

2) Apply the control input

μ(x(k)) = u(k).

3) Return to step 1 until the ﬁnal time N.

Solving an open loop problem allows us avoid the compli-
cations of the curse of dimensionality, yet recomputation at
each step while in a feedback loop leads to good performance
(as has been seen in a multitude of very complex industrial
applications [23]).

(4)

C. Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control

A widely successful controller for many industrial appli-
cations is the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.
An advantage of this controller is that no prior knowledge of
the plant parameters is required and yet, via appropriate tuning,
good performance is often obtained even for nonlinear models
with random variables, as is the case here. PID control is the
most widely implemented feedback controller in the world,
with successful application to countless challenging feedback
control problems.

1) Formulation: As the PID controller does not explicitly
consider the minimization of a cost function in its usual
form, we build a reference vector r (k), where the reference
trajectories are ramps from the initial condition x0 to the
with given slopes for each state, denoted
desired values x
by the vector S. The goal of the controller will be to drive the
error e(k) = r (k) − x(k) to zero, where the reference vector
r (k) is

∗

r (k) = min{x0 + k S, x

∗}.

We deﬁne a PID controller as the feedback law correspond-
ing to each input ui (k) for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Each controller
produces an input based on the error value deﬁned as ei (k) =
ri (k) − xi (k), then

ui (k) = Pi (k) + Ii (k) + Di (k)

for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}

where

Pi (k) = K p,i ei (k),

Ii (k) = Ii (k − 1) + Kt,i ei (k)

and

Di (k) =

Kd,i

Kd,i + Kn,i
+ Kd,i Kn,i
Kd,i + Kn,i

Di (k − 1)
(ei (k) − ei (k − 1))

where Pi (k), Ii (k), and Di (k) are the proportional, integral,
and derivative terms and in the same way, the constants K p,i ,
Kt,i , and Kd,i are the proportional, integral, and derivative
gains, and Kn,i is the “ﬁlter coefﬁcient.”

To tune the controller gains for the three PID controllers,
simulations were performed to ﬁnd the parameters that min-
imize both the error vector e(k) = [e1(k), e2(k), e3(k)]T and
at the same time make the controller reliable, deﬁned in this
brief as the ability to avoid “management failures,” i.e., the
event where, at some time period k, the controller is unable
to ﬁnd a solution within the feasible set Uk. The management
failure event represents the situation, where there is not enough
liquidity to ensure the acquisition of basic needs to ensure
subsistence. We develop a “projection algorithm” to ensure
that the control input remains in the feasible set Uk.

IV. RESULTS

In the ﬁrst part of this section, we will show results
for time trajectories, computational complexity, and goal
attainment performance for the three controllers implemented.
In the second part, further assessment on disturbance rejection,
reliability, and cash transfer is performed on the MPC and PID
controllers.

A. Simulation Parameters
The time length considered is N = 150 weeks, with the
sample interval equal to one week. The random return on
investment is

i2(k) = μ + σ (k).

In the following simulations, we chose μ ∈ 0.22, 0.4, which
lie within the range found in [2]. The volatility of the return
on the investment σ (k) follows a discrete normal distribution
with zero mean and standard deviation σ = μ/4. Furthermore,
the variables s1(k) and s2(k), corresponding to discrete shocks,
were generated in the following way [24] and both follow the
same probability mass function

The minimum consumption is umin = 6.7 that represents
an expenditure of around $0.95 per day for an individ-
ual. Lower amounts are not considered as the spirit of
these ﬁnancial advisors is to keep a relative digniﬁed liveli-
hood across the process. The initial conditions were cho-
sen to be x(0) = [cmin, clim, 0]T to denote an agent that
who can access a credit equal
to his/her initial endow-

individual with higher priority to consume, followed by the
desire to accumulate capital and cash in hand. Hence, the
goal is to increase capital and at the same time increment
the consumption while managing the debt.

B. Performance

With respect to controller parameters, for the DP approach,
we had to discretize both the state and control spaces and
build a ﬁnite Markov chain to obtain a desired feedback
law within our computational capabilities. For this, we chose
x1(k) ∈ [0, 90], x2(k) ∈ [0, 250],
x3(k) ∈ [0, clim],
u1(k) ∈ [6.7, 90], u2(k) ∈ [−90, 50}, and u3(k) ∈ [clim, clim].
We employ 15 discretization points for each variable and use a
scattered data interpolation algorithm based on triangulation of
the points on the optimal policy and state space. With this, we
avoid the computational intensive methods of approximate pol-
icy iteration, which usually require a large number of simula-
tions to train a neural network that approximates the cost-to-go
function. To discretize the random variable σ (k), we employ a

binomial distribution. For the MPC, the prediction horizon was
chosen as m = 15 simulating that the controller would have
an estimation of the mean return on investment micrometer
of up to ﬁfteen weeks. We tuned the PID controllers to
obtain a good compromise between tracking and reliability
performance. We chose, after tuning, for PID controller 1,
K p,1 = −1.1025, Kt,1 = −0.6615, and Kd,1 = 0, for PID
controller 2, K p,2 = 1.1025, Kt,2 = 0.6615, and Kd,2 = 0,
and for PID controller 3, K p,3 = −1.1025, Kt,3 = −0.0662,
and Kd,3 = 0. We also determined PID’s ramp slope to allow
higher consumption and maintain reliability by reaching the
desired values at the 25th week.

To show the results of tracking performance, we evaluate
time trajectories for the three controllers, for two different
cases: 1) a relatively well endowed and skilled individual with
μ = 0.4 and clim = 50 and 2) an unskilled individual with low
initial capital and credit limit, with μ = 0.22 and clim = 25.
All simulations were performed under the same sequence
of random numbers, and to simplify the implementation of
the DP controller, we chose s1 = 0 in these ﬁrst round
of simulations. Fig. 1 shows the results of x(k) and u(k)
for DP, MPC, and PID controllers for case 2). It can be
seen that the MPC and DP provide a “smoother” regulation
around the desired consumption than the PID whose tuning set
points are seen in the more “aggressive” behavior. However,
the PID shows that it is practical to climb the ramp toward
the desired state while managing debt. In the initial stages
of the simulation, all controllers reduce consumption to the
minimum while accumulating assets that generate income.
Also, notice the reaction of the controllers to a shock: the
MPC and DP incur a debt and repay the loan in several
weeks in order to maintain consumption as high as possible,
whereas the PID projection algorithm responds by practically
not taking any loans and instead, it reduces consumption.
This is due to the fact that the desired consumption was not
explicitly used in the PID formulation and that the projection
algorithm ﬁnds the closest point in the control space Uk from
the output of the PID. Fig. 2 shows results for average wealth
(x1 + x2 − x3) over time using Monte Carlo simulations with
1500 runs for the unskilled and skilled cases. The boxes edges
correspond to ﬁrst and third quartiles, the notches represent
median, and the outer horizontal lines are within a distance
of 1.5 interquartile distance from the median. We see that
although the DP controller uses an interpolation of its discrete
state space, it achieves a similar performance than the MPC,
specially for the skilled case, when the individual is well
endowed to achieve the desired wealth. The PID shows its
ability to track the reference trajectory, showing little variance
between Monte Carlo runs.

C. Computational Complexity

To further compare the strategies, an analysis of computa-
tional complexity is performed, measuring the time in seconds
to perform the controllers’ computation within the simulation
on a PC and the memory used to store the required variables.
To compute the time, we use the tic/toc function in MATLAB
that uses internal sources of time service. This analysis is

TABLE I

PROCESSING TIME IN SECONDS

The preprocessing stage refers to any process that occurs
before the actual simulation and in this speciﬁc case,
it
only refers to the time and memory employed to obtain the
optimal policy for the DP, where the effects of the curse of
dimensionality are clearly seen, especially in terms of memory
use. With respect to the actual simulation time, the MPC
processing time is 37 times higher than the PID, basically
because of the optimization process that has to be performed
at each iteration in the MPC. The extensive time and memory
required to compute the optimal policy for the DP case makes
the analysis performed in Sections IV.D and IV.E very lengthy,
where variations in the model parameters are considered. This
fact will make the DP approach infeasible in cases where there
exists uncertainty about the process parameters, and several
preprocessing processes would be needed.

D. Disturbance Rejection

To further assess the performance of the controllers, we
analyze the disturbance rejection behavior for two sources
of uncertainties in the model: the multiplicative disturbance
on the volatility of the return on investment σ (k) and the
effect of the agent not following the advice, represented by
the random vector z(k), which is a Gaussian additive input
disturbance with mean 1. Hence, in the latter case, the actual
consumption is u1(k) = u1(k)+z(k), i.e., on average, the agent
is consuming more and investing less than what is suggested.
Taking μ = 0.3 and clim = 66.67, x
∗ = [80, 300, 0], the
plot in the top of Fig. 3(a) shows the effects of σ on wealth
w(k) = x1(k)+x2(k)−x3(k) for the MPC, with the horizontal
lines as the median wealth for a 2000 run Monte Carlo
simulation, and the bottom and top edges of the boxes are
the ﬁrst and third quartile. The dotted line represents the
desired value for wealth. The bottom plot of Fig. 3(a) shows
the same result, now with respect to the standard deviation
of input disturbance z(k) and ﬁxing σ = 0.075. Fig. 3(a)
shows similar results for the PID controller. It can be seen
that both MPC and PID maintain wealth close to its desired
value despite the uncertainties. Although when σ is higher
than 0.267, or roughly 90% of the mean return on investment
micrometer, the PID performance degrades abruptly again due
to the constraints in the model that leads to management
failures, while the MPC does good tracking of desired wealth.
With respect to input disturbance rejection, we see that for
the values chosen, all controllers maintain wealth close to the
desired value, with the PID controller performing better by
allowing less deviation from the reference.

E. Reliability

In Section IV-D, we showed that the consumption and debt
payment must be held at the minimum values, and maximum

capital investment must be set to achieve the desired wealth
quickly. However, it has to be clariﬁed that not all agents are
sufﬁciently endowed to climb that wealth ramp, and suffer the
effects of the scarcity constraints. In [7], is it described how
agents with low skills and low initial capital perform several
transfers between cash in hand, capital, and debt in order to
secure consumption and subsistence. Considering those issues,
the aim of this section is to show how the feedback controllers
perform in situations, where the effects of the input constraints
in (2a)–(2d) are more severe. To measure such performance,
we deﬁne a reliability index, which takes a value of zero (0)
if the simulation failed with a management failure as deﬁned
in Section III-C1, whereas it takes value one (1) if the run has
not failed. Fig. 4 shows average reliability index results using
2000 runs in a Monte Carlo simulation for the three con-
trollers. The axes are the mean return on investment microme-
ter and initial capital x2(0) = clim. Here, the plots correspond
to the MPC (top) and PID (bottom). The plots present two
clearly differentiated zones and an intermediate zone. The zone
to the top-right of the plot corresponds to agents endowed
well enough to reach the desired states and control inputs

is zero for households with initial wealth and mean return
on investment that lies in the bottom-left of the plot, in the
“management failure zone.” We can see that both MPC and
PID show very similar reliability performance. Note that the
red dots in the plots represent the individual parameters used
in the simulations in Fig. 1.

These results show what can be interpreted as a “poverty
trap,” using the terms deﬁned in [25], where the low ability to
obtain income (low micrometer) and low initial endowment
hinder the possibility of reaching the desired wealth and
spending. However, in [25], the poverty trap is a consequence
of multiple equilibria in a nonlinear system, whereas in our
case, it can be argued that the set of points whose initial
conditions are in the trap are not included in any positive
invariant set for closed loop system as deﬁned in [26]. Thus,
according to the same reference, the system does not show
persistent feasibility, implying that there is no control law that
can steer the system to the desired values without violating
the constraints.

F. PID-Based Cash Transfer Program

As we argued above, some agents will not be able to reach
the desired wealth despite the use of the ﬁnancial advisors due
to system’s properties and parameters. As the goal of this brief

2200

is to explore an alternative to assist low income people in their
quest for ﬁnancial reliability, it is convenient to ask, which
are some efﬁcient ways to help them beyond the scope of the
tools we propose. For this, we select agents with characteristics
that lie inside the “poverty trap” described above and assume
that they employ the MPC ﬁnancial advisor. Then, we analyze
three prospective interventions or aid programs to assist these
agents: 1) weekly cash transfers into x1(k), usually framed as
“unconditional cash transfers;” 2) a lump sum cash transfer
into x1(k) performed once at the beginning of the simulation;
and 3) weekly “controlled” cash transfers onto x1(k). We use
the word “controlled” to denote the fact that the amount of
the transfer will be the output of a PI controller that has as an
input the difference between the individual’s current wealth
and a desired wealth trajectory, modeled here as a ramp,
similar to the implemented for the PID controllers above.
We assume that the transfers are only performed during the
ﬁrst 30 weeks of the simulation. We compare the transfer
methods by measuring performance in terms of mean and
standard deviation of the reliability index for several ﬁxed
funding amounts available for transfer programs and degrees
of uncertainty. We deﬁne the degree of uncertainty with a “risk
parameter” P ∈ [0, 0.2] as follows: shocks s1 and s2 will vary
according to

p(s1(k)) = p(s2(k)) =

⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩

1 − P if s1(k) = 0
if s1(k) = P
1/3P
if s1(k) = 2P
1/3P
if s1(k) = 3P.
1/3P

An input disturbance, i.e., the effect of the individual not
following the advice, will also be modeled in terms of P
with a Gaussian random variable with mean 10P and standard
deviation P/10. We take μ = 0.15, cmin = 6.7, and clim = 30
to simulate an individual in the management failure zone. PID
controller parameters are taken to be K p = 0.95, Ki = 0.15,
and Kd = 0, tuned to provide higher reliability, and the
wealth reference ramp is designed such that the desired wealth
is achieved in a year, in the 52nd week. Fig. 5 shows the
performance results for each transfer program. The top plot of
Fig. 5(a) shows mean wealth reliability index and the bottom
plot shows its standard deviation for a 2000-run Monte Carlo
simulation for the distributed cash transfer program, while the
results for the lump sum and controlled transfer programs are
shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively. Both the lump sum
and the controlled program show higher values of reliability
index than the distributed weekly cash transfers for the lower
amounts of program funding. The standard deviation is high
for the values of funding and P, where the programs transition
from failure (reliability = 0) to success (reliability = 1). These
observations show the clear effect of the poverty trap and the
importance of a “big push” provided by large transfers at the
beginning of the program to overcome the trap. The controlled
transfer program seems to provide a similar performance than
the lump sum program both in terms of mean and standard
deviation, with a small advantage when it comes to low values
of program funding. Although the results are promising for
the PID-based cash transfer program, more analysis is needed

to determine which program is viable, such as availability
of funds at the beginning of the simulation for the lump
sum program or if the controlled transfer program could
be implemented with an estimate of the individual’s wealth
(relaxing the assumption that he/she uses the ﬁnancial advisor),
among others.

2201

V. CONCLUSION

We have evaluated three feedback controllers that could help
manage the ﬁnancial lives of the poor. Based on a tracking
performance similar to the one shown by the DP controller
with lower computational effort, along with adequate distur-
bance rejection behavior, we conclude that the MPC and PID
controllers are viable tools to help manage the ﬁnancial lives
of the poor, with the advantage of smoother consumption
patterns provided by MPC, which is a desired feature when
considering real implementations. The reliability results also
showed that both PID and MPC can manage the ﬁnancial
lives of low-skilled and low-endowed agents but only up to
a certain threshold, beyond which external intervention is
needed to ensure present and future subsistence under limited
resources. The controllers allowed households to be better
prepared to deal with uncertain income and shocks via proper
management of their ﬁnancial life, building the savings that
may grant them the ability to perform the necessary invest-
ments to improve their well-being. We also tested a PID-based
cash transfer program, with similar reliability improvement
results to those obtained with a lump sum transfer method.
Future work could be done on modeling the dynamics of
the return on the investment i2(k), including the effects of
education, health, and market factors, using adaptive control
and estimation methods. It would be interesting to incorporate
the ﬁndings in behavioral economics into the design of the
controllers. In addition, the effects of cooperation/competition
between agents via decentralized control techniques could be
considered.
